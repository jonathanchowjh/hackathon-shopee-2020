"First of all, I'd like to extend my gratitude to the event organizer for putting me at the first place today to come clean about my daredevil experience.",首先呢，非常感谢这个主办方，能够把一个这个亡命之徒放在第一个做坦白交待。
"At the very beginning, I'd like to introduce the accomplices of my band of daredevil to you.",然后在康开始的时候，我先给大家介绍一下，就是我们这个亡命之徒的同伙。
"There are men, women, teenagers, and even people infected by virus in the band. ",呃在我们亡命之徒的这个同伙里面有男人，也有女人，然后也有孩子，甚至还有这个病毒的感染者。
And some of them are not human beings at all.,呃还有一众亡命之徒它并不是人。
The daredevils are very adventurous as well as aggressive in some cases.,然后亡命之徒呢总是很喜欢冒险，然后他们偶尔也比较喜欢好斗。
"However, they are always persistent to fight for their dreams.",这群亡命之徒呢，一直在为着自己的理想然后在坚持着。
So what I want to share with you today is how to become a daredevil in the O2O industry.,所以说就是我想跟各位今天来分享的就是如何去做一个O2O领域的亡命之徒。 
Let me brief you what is O2O first. ,先给大家讲一下什么叫做O2O。
O2O refers to the offline-to-online sale of services.,就是把线下的服
"O2O sells services, which is different from B2C that sells products.",不同是什么，就是O2O呢，卖的是服务；然后B2C呢，卖的是这个实物。
"You can buy a real product by logging in on shopping websites like JD.com or Taobao at home, and then receive what you buy at your doorstep.",在家里面啊，你通过上京东淘宝这一系列的网站，你可以买到一个实物，然后而且不用出门就可以把这个实物拿到手，并且使用。
But O2O is trying to sell a certain service on the Internet.,但是做O2O呢，就是把一个服务放到互联网上进行销售。
"For example, when we place an order for a meal or a haircut online, it would be very complicated to complete a closed-loop consumption procedure, that is to say we have to go offline for the rest of the order however we make the deal online.",然后比如说我们要买一个买一顿饭，对吧，我们要去理发，在网上先买一个理发，但是这里面有一个非常大的难度，就是无论我在线上怎么交易，我都要跑到线下面进行这个消费，然后把这个消费闭环做完整。
So there exist huge difficulties when we are embarking on O2O.,所以说在做这个O2O这件事来讲的话，是一个极其大的难度。 
Why do we have to do O2O like a daredevil and how difficult it is? ,干这个O2O呢，这个为什么会有亡命之徒的心态，然后这个O2O呢到底有多难。
Here are my answers.,我接下来给大家介绍一下。
The forerunner of O2O industry is the group-buying websites. ,就是干O2O的第一拨人是这个团购网站。
As we all know that one of the most popular internet sensations two or three years ago was group-buying. ,大家知道在两三年前最火的这个这个互联网就是团购。
Thousands of group-buying service providers could pop up online overnight.,一夜之间几万家团购同时上线。
Then everyone was snapping up the low-cost services and food online.,然后大家拼命地在网上购买着非常低廉的这个服务，然后大家可能也吃到很多廉价的好吃的，也用过很多廉价的这种服务。
"Here is a very typical example, in Shanghai, many people would flock to Da Tong Da for foot massage. ",比如说这个上海最最明显的就是经常有人去那个“大桶大”里面做这个足疗按摩。
"The regular foot massage service in Da Tong Da cost more than 100 RMB per person, but the price would be cut down to tens of or less than twenty RMB if you purchased the service via group-buying.",“大桶大”正常的话要100多块钱一个，如果通过团购可能几十块钱，甚至十几块钱就能享受到这项服务。
"However, after the period of frantic competitions among such websites, what we often hear about today is the shutdown of group-buying websites, don't we? ",但是呢，这个百团大战之后以及到今天，我们听到更多的是团购网站的死去，对吧。
I guess there are few of group-buying websites now.,现在估计存活的团购网站已经没有几个了。
So these are the pioneers of O2O.,这就是在O2O世界里面做第一拨的人。
Then who are the follow-up successors of O2O? ,那在O2O里面做第二波的人呢。
They just vanished before they got closer to the edge of the industry.,这个其实跟O2O还没沾上点边就已经挂了。
I'd like to give your some examples. ,这里面我给各位举几个例子啊。
I describe a phenomenon to you without giving out the brand name.,我不提这个品牌，我给大家讲一个形态。
We used to find out many teenage boys and girls gathering around a machine at metro station to get a kind of coupons for offline shopping.,就是大家经常会看到很多少男少女们在某个地铁站围着一个机器拼命地去打一种优惠券儿，然后去进线下消费。
But this could only be seen about two years ago. ,但是可能这个停留在两年前的概念。
Now let's think about it very carefully. ,但是在今天大家再仔细回忆一下。
Can you see any teenagers gathering around a machine at a metro station now?,如果各位再从地铁站周围观顾的时候，不知道您是否还看得到少男少女围着机器，对吧。
Let's go back to O2O. ,然后这个O2O里面来讲的话呢。
Piles of O2O companies keep springing up.,就说还有一波新的一波在做O2O的这种这个公司。
"There is still no one out of these companies succeeding in figuring out the closed-loop consumption pattern of O2O, that consumers could adapt to in an easier manner.",那这些公司来讲的话，目前没有一家公司成功地摸索出来这个O2O到底是怎么样的一个闭环，怎么样的这个让消费者使用起来更轻松。
"From this perspective, O2O industry is destined to die.",所以说呢，这个O2O产业来讲的话，目前还是一个必死的产业。
But we cannot simply give it up for its doomed destiny.,但是说不能说因为必死，这件事就不要干了。
Here is a very simple example.,举个很简单的例子。
I watched all videos about Jack Ma. ,我看过马云所有的这个视频。
He proposed ten years ago to put clothes and shoes from offline sales to online sales.,马云在十年前说，啊我们要做把线下的服装跟鞋子放到网上去卖。
"Many people at that time didn’t buy it, questioning that people had to try the clothes and shoes on to see if they fit or match with the pants. ",当时有很多人就说这个根本不可能，我到线下去试一试衣服合不合身，鞋子总要试一试，然后甚至跟我的裤子要不要搭。
So Jack Ma's idea encountered many obstacles.,所以说当时也遇到了很大的障碍。
"Now, ten years later, when you take a look at the B2C industry, you can barely find anyone who doesn't buy clothes, shoes, and even home appliances online.",十年后的今天我们再看这个B2C，你会发现有多少人不在互联网上去买衣服呢，有多少人不在互联网上去消费这些鞋子，甚至是电器。
So the Internet does bring impact and transformation to the offline consumption pattern.,所以说这个互联网的确是震慑住了这个整个的线下的消费模式，也也扭转了线那个线下消费模式。
"Next I'd like to answer a question that if O2O is destined to die, is it too early to propel it now? ",然后呢再跟各位讲，就是为什么啧你既然说这个O2O是必死的，是不是做得太早啦？
What if the industry just perishes abruptly?,是不是这个会死在前面儿？
Where did this argument come from? ,这话是怎么说的呢？
"Here is the thing, do you know what is the first batch of listed internet enterprises?",是这样的，就是嗯第一波互联网上市的企业，大家知道是什么类型的产品吗？
"Yes, the first batch is portal website, such as Yahoo.",对，第一波上市的是这个雅虎，门户类型的。
"By the end of 1990s or the early 2000s, we began to find out that many portal websites were listed.",当那个年代九九十年代末的时候，我们噼里啪啦听到一大堆或者两千年后的时候听到一大堆门户网站开始上市了。
Then what is the second batch of listed internet companies? ,然后紧接着第二波上市的浪潮呢是谁呢？
They are game developers represented by Shanda Group.,是做游戏的一帮，以盛大为为代表啊，盛大这个这一系列的游戏公司。
Later on we find out many function-based internet enterprises come into the market.,然后后来来讲的话我们又听到一些工具类的这个互联网企业陆陆续续上市。
What we've heard most these couple of years is that the transactional B2C companies are listed.,然后在这两年我们听到最多的是这种交易类型的B2C在上市，对吧。
"We notice that we post-80s generation needs at least ten years to develop a new industry and accumulate the knowledge, as a saying goes that it takes ten years to forge a good sword.",然后我们就发现留给我们八零后，因为我们成长一个行行业，知识一个沉淀嘛，必须要需要10年的时间，10年磨一剑嘛。
"So when we find ourselves know a little about the internet, we must choose a business inside the sector and carry on doing it, that business seems to be O2O.",所以说在我们发现哎呀我今天能对互联网有一些认知的，有一些明白了，有一些理解了，我现在要选选择一个事业执着地干下去，那貌似只有O2O了。 
"Next I'd like to talk about the internet industry environment, that's the reason why I hold on to O2O.",然后再讲讲这个互联网的产业环境啊，就是为什么我还是非得抓着O2O不放。
"In the internet industry, your entrepreneurial plans will always be overshadowed by those from the three internet giants, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. ",就是产业环境是这样，无论我现在去做一个什么你都会，在互联网业界的人都知道互联网有三座大山，对吧，这个百度，这个阿里，还有腾讯，
"Although Baidu CEO Robin Li Yanhong said at this year's IT Summit that the three giants are not rocks lying ahead of young entrepreneurs, in my opinion, they hinder many of start-ups.",尽管这个新一届的IT峰会里面这个李彦宏Robin说三座大山不是年轻人的创业障碍，但是我始终感觉在我们创业的这个人来看还是一种障碍。
Here is a simple example.,在这里面我举一个简单的例子啊。
"Baidu is a prominent money spinner, and it's capable of acquiring many enterprises in different sectors in one night.",就是百度呢是以这个吸金能力比较强的这个一个企业，然后在一夜之间大家会发现它收购了很多企业。
Then I would say I can start up my business in another sector. ,然后你说哎呀那这一片儿我就不做了嘛，那我就去做另外一片儿。
What else can you do?,你说那还做什么呢？
Let's try online transaction.,做交易吧。
However you'll find it's very difficult to beat Alibaba no matter how hard you try in online transaction.,你会发现交易怎么做你都很难去跨越这个阿里集团，对吧。
All your payments have to go through Alipay. ,无论如何你的支付的解决行为还得在支付宝啊。
You are surrounded by Alibaba's products. ,总是离不开阿里的产品。
Plus Alibaba is a strong acquirer too.,而且阿里的收购能力也很强。
Here comes Tencent.,然后我们再说腾讯。
"I bet that whatever you make, you will lose your market the next day after Tencent embarks on developing the same stuff against yours.",这个腾讯我在这里面可能说无论你做出什么样的产品，只要让它看上眼了，对吧，第二天你就可以失业了。
"In conclusion, start up your own business is extremely tough.",所以说从这一点来讲的话，你会发现哎呀创业真的好难。
However these three internet giants will turn a deaf ear to O2O before people figure it out.,但是O2O在谁都没有搞明白的时候，这三座大山是看不上眼的。
So they all choose to stay put instead of making a tiny step forward.,所以说几家纷纷在蠢蠢欲动，但是而没有动。
"So I think a new opportunity is forthcoming, and O2O is the most workable option among all.",所以说我就认为啊机会又来了，以这三个机会来看来讲的话啊，呃貌似我只有O2O可以干。
"But the process of doing O2O is very, very torturing.",但是做O2O这件事儿呢，是一件特别特别痛苦的一件事。
"First of all, we must meet a large amount of clients everyday. ",第一来讲的话我们每天要面临着大量的商户。
"For instance, the sector of daily life services includes eateries, hairdressing, beauty and spa, educational training, mother-and-baby care as well as wedding planning.",比如说举个例子，这个餐饮店，丽容美发spa店，然后教育培训这类型的店，然后还有做母婴、结婚这一类的全部都是属于生活服务领域范畴。
But why do I say it's difficult?,但是为什么难呢？
"In B2C industry, I can produce a computer following strict standards.",比如说做B2C，我做一款产品做电脑，它的标准化很强，对吧。
"The production of a computer involves nothing else but the CPU, the hard drive capacity and the screen size.",我做一台这个这个电脑它无非就是CPU，然后无非就是硬盘有多大，无非屏幕有多大。
"But in O2O industry, when you are opening a restaurant, take hot pot as an example, you will find categories like Chongqing hot pot, Beijing hot pot and Taiwan mini hot pot, won't you?",但是你会发现做O2O这个行业啊，如果你要做餐饮店的时候，咱们就单拿一个火锅来举例，它就有重庆火锅、北京火锅、台湾小火锅，对吧？
"For Chongqing hot pot, the restaurant owner could be a Sichuan native, a Sichuan non-local, and even those who are from investment circle.",单拿重庆火锅来举例它的老板有四川人，有伪四川人，对吧，甚至还有投资界的朋友在做这方面的东西。
And then you can tell the varying levels of restaurant owners just from the service attitude and quality of restaurant waiters.,然后你会发现从业者参差不齐，对吧，从服务员的态度素质就知道。
"Every one knows about the stories of Haidilao hot pot, right?",大家都知道这个海底捞儿的故事，对吧。
And you might also know how other hot pot restaurant owners run their businesses. ,然后大家可能也会知道不是海底捞儿那些企业是怎么经营的。
So the standardization level of Sichuan hot pot is far from satisfaction.,所以说单看一个四川火锅标准性，标准化很差。
"In that respect, it's quite difficult to do O2O as we may come across various clients.",所以说从这个角度来讲的话，那就我们认为这件事来讲的话干起来太痛苦了，每家店都是千奇百怪啊。
I myself have led two O2O teams from Beijing to Shanghai.,然后呢就是这个我呢现在是带过两个团队，从北京一直带到上海，一直在做O2O。
Why do I put forward the concept of daredevil?,然后我为什么要提出这个亡命之徒的概念呢？
Many young people nowadays have many job options; venture capital and headhunting industries are picking up momentum. ,现在很多年轻人啊有太多的选择，然后这个现在风投能力也比较强，一夜之间挖人能力也比较强。
Young people get used to job-hopping driven by benefits.,所以说很多年轻人呢在利益的驱动下，该跳槽的跳槽，该转业的转业。
"I often talk to my teams, saying if you've stuck to the jobs in one industry for ten years, you will become a top expert in it.",我经常跟我的团队经常沟通这样一件事情，我说一个行业如果你坚持做一做十年，那你就是这个行业的专家，啊。
"In this regard, I'd like to encourage all young people, if you are working in O2O industry, stick with it just like a daredevil.",所以说在个这里面我就想提倡所有的年轻人，就是说在在做一件事情，在做O2O这条路上面来讲的话，有一种亡命之徒的态度，把这件事儿做下去。
I firmly believe O2O will create a chance for young people and will bring about bigger market impact. ,我坚信这一件事情来讲的话，一定会给年轻人一个机会，而且一定会给这个市场一个更大的冲击力。
Thank you.,谢谢。
"Recently, I was busy with a play called Tuesdays with Morrie.",我最近刚忙着演一出戏，那个戏的名字叫作《最后十四堂星期二的课》。

The book was published in different countries around the world.,这个小说在世界上很多国家都有发行出版。
I bet many of you have heard of it or even read it.,相信搞不好在座有很多人也知道，或者搞不好也看过。
"The book was based on the story of an old professor who suffered from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, an incurable disease and had only a few times left to live.",这个故事是叙述一位老教授，他得了一个罕见疾病，叫作渐冻症，那是一个不治的绝症，他在世的日子不多了。
One of his students visited him every Tuesday for 14 times.,但他有个学生，哎，一个心爱的学生来探望他，每个星期二来探望他，然后前前后后来了十四次。
"On the 14th visit which turned out to be the last, the professor passed away in his last lesson.",第十四次当然也就是最后一次，在那一堂课当中，那位老教授他呀，咽气，与世长辞。
"Throughout the play, it was very quiet on the stage for there were only two actors, starring as the professor and his student.",然后这个故事在演出当中，台上非常地安静，因为从头到尾台上只有两个人没有第三个人，就是那个老师和那个学生。
"The plot is not complicated nor dramatic, just some talks about different topics, including death.",然后，这故事也没有什么复杂的剧情没什么很戏剧性花里花哨的一些事儿，就是这个师生二人聊天儿，然后聊了许多话题，其中也包括啊死亡。
"Since the play goes on with few dramatic conflicts, the reaction of the audience seemed interesting.",观众在这个时候有个很有意思的感觉，因为整个戏进行得非常安静。
"The audience seemed to become some invisible onlookers, standing by the sickbed of the dying professor, listening to his 14 lessons and watched his journey to death.",观众们好像在无声中他化身为一个隐形的旁观者，一个旁观者站在这个临终病床旁边，目送这位老教授从第一堂课到第十四堂课，目送这位老教授他一步一步一步走向死亡。

So it was expected to hear some laughter during the play after we went through rehearsal.,额我们在排戏的时候就可以预期地到演出的时候会有一些什么地方观众会乐，会笑。
"However, considering that the scene was after all about the ward of a terminal patient lying on the bed.",可是无论如何毕竟这个舞台好像一个临终病房。
All the audience witnessed the old man being tortured by the illness and struggling for the last breath.,老人家躺在病床上，然后我们所有围观者，所有围观者就等于是观众，他们好像是送行者，我们目看着老先生饱受疾病的折磨，看着他一步一步要快要咽气。
Wasn't it weird yet intereseting to laugh at such a scene?,这个时候，笑是不是有一点啊有一点啧奇怪，有一点有点什么意思？
"In China's conservative tradition, if you laugh out before a dying elder surrounded by other visitors, you will get criticized and feel guilty about yourself.",在咱们这种中国人保守的这这个传统里头，如果长者躺床上要过去了，我们旁边围站一圈，嗯这个时候如果你笑，你会被别人责怪，你也会自己责怪自己。
"People would say, ""Are you insane? Are you crazy? Why are you so impolite? How disrespectful you are! How can you show no respect to elders?""",责怪你这个人是不是脑袋有问题啊？你不是神经病啊？你怎么这么不懂事啊？怎么不这么不孝顺呢？怎么这么不尊重老人者啊？

What could we say then?,因为这个时候说什么呀？
It felt like whatever we said would seem inappropriate.,这不是怎么说都话好像都不是不是不是很对、不恰当。

That feeling lingered on. When I bowed and bid farewell to my friend in the mortuary house and on his funeral a couple of days after the visit and when I recalled him later at any time。,那个得意之情一直延伸到后来没有多少天之后我们在殡仪馆在告别式上跟我这个朋友鞠躬行礼，一直延伸到更后来后来后来当我每想起我这位朋友的时候我心里都有一个话语在心中浮现。
"I think to myself, ""Bro, we almost got scared by death. Fortunately, we didn't. It was because we could, we were able to and we dared to laugh before the death. We testified with laugh that we were still who we were and would not be defeated by death.""",我说：“兄弟啊，我们差一点就被死亡给吓到了，还好没有，因为我们笑了，我们我们能笑，我们可以笑，而且我们敢笑，因为我们笑了我们用笑声来证明，哥们儿，我们还是我们，死神你给我站到一边去。”

Is that all?,然后没有别的吗？
I don't think so.,不会，不会吧。
"Suppose we are close, you don't want to see me just crying, do you?",假如我们关系这么好，你不会希望我只只是什么这这么表达，应该还有些别的吧？

There are different possible ways than just crying.,有许多许多可能，但是不可以止于在那里哭。
"However, crying is probably the only thing we could do due to our conservative tradition and the society.",而咱们这个社会我们这个传统，很多很多的人大概只能做那个事儿。
"If you come to see me off when I leave, I will assure you that the last thing I want to see is you crying.",我跟你讲如果是我我要走你来送我，我告诉你我可不希望我看到的画面就那个。
Because I will be worried about you and can't go far away.,因为如果是那样的话，答案很简单，我不能远行到任何地方我都走不远，因为我不会心安。
My speech is coming to the end.,我说到这儿我的话就快要准备结束了。
"Before that, I want to quote again from the play Tuesdays with Morrie.",在结束之前我预备再引用一句我在《最后十四堂星期二的课》这个戏当中的一句台词。
Actually it's my first line in the play.,这是我这个角色在剧中出场的第一句台词。
"Right after the graduation ceremony at one university, a student of mine, who was very shy and poor at expressing himself, looked around to check his surroundings and found it was clear, so he lowered his head and prepared to sneak away.",时间是在一个大学的毕业典礼，典礼刚结束，我的一个学生，他个性非常腼腆内向不擅长表达，在典礼结束之后他左看右看没什么人低头正预备偷偷溜走闪人。
But I caught him right on the scene.,被我叫住。
"""Hey, where are you going, kid? Do you really think you can get out stealthily of the place where you stayed for four years without saying anything?"" I asked.",我说：“喂喂喂喂喂喂，你要到哪里去啊？你真的以为再见都不说一声就可以这么偷偷摸摸地告别你读了四年的大学啊？”
"He faltered, ""Oh, professor, actually, I don't know how to say goodbye.""",那个学生啊嗯支支吾吾然后努力地回答我说：“老师啊，啊，其实我不知道怎么说再见。”
"Well, that's a dreadful question since human beings came to the world.",啊！这是一个大灾问，这是人类亘古以来的问题。
It makes us cringe to say goodbye.,我们不会说再见。

Hello everyone!,大家好！
"I am Wei Likai, an audio engineer from Baidu Voice Technology Department.",我是语音技术部语音研发工程师魏利开。
Today I will give you some details on the applications of voice technology.,今天给大家介绍一些语音技术实战的情况。
"As of now, our three technologies including automated voice recognition, Text-to-Speech and voice wake-up have already been opened to users.",目前百度语音已经开放的技术有语音识别、合成和唤醒三个方向。
"Among which, voice wake-up is a purely off-line technology.",啊唤醒是纯离线的技术。
Automated voice recognition and Text-to-Speech are both accessible online and offline.,语音识别和合成是有既有离线又有在线。
"And they are available on android and IOS, as well as the SDKs of these two platforms.",啊提供的平台有安卓、IOS两个平台的SDK。Z
"In addition, the two platforms also provide REST API.",并且呢呃在这两个平台之外还提供REST API的接口。
"Because this lesson only lasts for about 15 minutes, I therefore directly use the simplest REST API to show automated voice recognition and Text-to-Speech, followed by a simple operation to demonstrate the capability of SDK.",呃由于这一节课程的时间限制比较短，只有十五分钟左右，那我就直接用最简单的REST API来演示语音识别和合成，然后通过一个简单的操作去展示一下SDK的能力。
"All codes involved can be downloaded from GitHub, and the download link can be found in the appendix of this lesson.",呃涉及到的代码呢都可以从GitHub上进行下载，下载地址可以在课程的附件中进行查找。
"Ok, let us start with the simplest operation. ",好，那我们就先从最简单的开始。
Let me show you the function of Text-to-Speech which is based on REST API.,首先我们看一下语音合成的功能展示，这个展示是基于REST API的。
"In order to use the function of Text-to-Speech, we need to complete two steps.",啊要使用基于REST API的语音合成功能呢，需要两个步骤。
"In the first step, we need to acquire a token which can be used to achieve Text-to-Speech synthesis through the synthesis interface.",第一个步骤就是先获取到token，获取到token之后，通过合成接口来进行合成。
"Now, let us give a try.",那我们呃实际操作一下。
"Search “Baidu Speech” via Baidu search engine and enter its official website, yuyin.baidu.com. ",搜索“百度语音”，进入百度语音官网yuyin.baidu.com。
"Find the ""Document Center"" where we can find ""Text-to-Speech REST API"".",进到“文档中心”，在“文档中心”中找到“语音合成REST API”。
"Then, find ""Authentication mechanism"" and click it.",然后再找到“鉴权认证机制”，点击进入。
This page contains an example link which can be used to acquire the token. ,在该页面有一个示例链接，这个链接就是用于获取token的。
"Now, let’s copy this example link into the address bar of the browser.",我们将这个链示例链接直接复制出去，贴到浏览器的地址栏。
"In this link, two parameters need to be replaced, namely client_id and client_secret.",在这个链接中有两个参数需要替换，client_id和client_secret。
Their corresponding keys can be found in Application Management. ,这两个key可以在应用管理中找到。
"Click ""View key"" in Application Management. ",应用管理中找到对应的应用点击“查看key”。
The API Key can be used to replace client_id and Secret Key to client_secret. ,这里的API Key分别与上面的client_id呃啊对应，啊Secret Key与client_secret对应。
Copy these two keys to replace the corresponding parameters in the original link. ,将其复制出去，替换为原链接的对应参数。
Then the token we need can be acquired by clicking Enter to open this page.,替换之后直接回车，打开这个页面即可得到我们需要的token。
"Next, we need to use the synthesis interface. ",啊这儿往后看，呃接下来我们再看啊实际的合成接口。
It can also be used by copying the example link to the address bar of the browser. ,合成接口也可以直接复制示例链接，将其贴到浏览器的地址栏。
Then fill in the tok and test fields with the tokens of the previous step.,然后将上一步的token填写到tok 这些字段。
"The CUID field, which means the unique ID of a device, can be filled in with ""test"".",啊CUID可以直接用test来表示，是指设备的唯一ID。
"The ""tex"" means the text to be synthesized. ",tx tex也就是要合成的文本。
"We put a text into the field: ""Example of Baidu Speech Synthesis"".",嗯这里直接搁上一段音频“百度语音合成示例”。
"Now that we have built the link we need, we can produce the voice we need to synthesize by clicking Enter to get: ""Example of Baidu Speech Synthesis"".",这个链接就这样就构造完了，然后直接回车即可得到我们需要的合成音频，“百度语音合成示例”。
"Of course, the tex field can be replaced by any text you need.",当然您可以将这个tex字段替换为你需要的任何文本。
"For example, you can enter ""Baidu Speech offers technical supports"" and click Enter to get the voice: ""Baidu Speech offers technical supports"".",比如“百度语音提供技术支持”，然后回车，“百度语音提供技术支持”。
This is the Text-to-Speech. ,刚才我们介绍了语音合成功能。
Then I will introduce automated speech recognition to all of you.,现在我们再看语音识别。
"As opposed to Text-to-Speech, Automated speech recognition is designed to convert speech into text.",那语音识别和语音合成正好是相反的过程，它是将音频文件转化成文本的过程。
The easiest way to use the automated speech recognition of Baidu is to use it through REST API interface.,那要使用百度语呃百度的语音识别功能，可以通过最简单方式，就是REST API接口来使用。
"Click the ""Document Center"" and find the REST API of automated speech recognition.",点击“文档中心”，找到语音识别REST API。
And authentication mechanism is also required.,同样也需要鉴权认证，鉴权认证。
"After acquiring the token, we can send our requests through the REST API interface of automated speech recognition.",啊获取到token之后，可以通过语音识别的REST API接口进行请求。
"Because it is very complicated to use REST AP and REST API of automated speech recognition, we cannot use them through a GET request.",啊由于语音识别的REST AP、REST API啊使用会复杂一些，无法通过GET请求直接使用。
"Therefore, we need to use a sample. ",所以我们借这里借助一个示例工程。
"Search GitHub through Baidu Search Engine and search ""Baidu Speech Sample"" on GitHub. ",搜索GitHub，在GitHub中搜到呃搜索百度语音示例。
"Find ""baidu speech sample"" and click it.",找到“baidu speech sample”，点击进入。
"In this sample, there is a category: rest api/asr.",在这个示例里边，包含了rest api的asr这个目录。
"After entering the category, you can find demonstrations in three languages and audio files of a sample.",点击进入，有三种语言的演示和一个示例的音频文件。
"In this case, we wish to use PHP to perform the demonstration.",这里我们希望使用PHP来进行操作演示。
"Therefore, we now need to download a PHP through a git clone request. ",因此我们将现在这个工程先下载下来，通过git clone命令，即可将其下载。
"Well, we already have a PHP that has already been downloaded. ",哎呦我这里已经有一个下载好的工程。
Enter the REST API catalogue and then asr. ,进到REST API目录，然后进入asr。
"As you can see, there is a sample audio file in pcm format: test.ppm pcm. ",然后啊在这些目录里面有一个示例音频文件是pcm格式test.ppm pcm。
"Because this computer is configured to operate in PHP environment, we can directly perform the demonstration using a PHP script.",啊我电脑现在有呃PHP的运行环境，因此呢直接用PHP脚本来进行演示。
"Then, we need to download the PHP script of this sample which has three parameters that need to be replaced.",啊我们编辑这个示例的PHP脚本，呃其中有三个参数需要替换。
"The CUID field, which means the unique ID of a device, should be filled in with ""test"".",cuid，啊也就是设备的唯一ID，我这里直接用test来表示。
Two keys that can also be found in the corresponding application of Baidu Voice Open Platform are needed.,然后需要呃开放平台的两个key，同样在语音的开放平台中，对应的应用中找到。
"First, we should fill in these fields with the API Key and then Secret Key. ",首先填写API Key，然后填写Secret Key。
"Then, we save the configuration and execute it through PHP script.",啊将其保存，然后通过PHP标PHP的脚本引擎执行。
"Our audio file is not in the current directory, so we edit the script again. ",噢我们的音频文件没有在当前目录，所以再一次进行编辑。
"As our sample audio file is in its parent directory, we can save the configuration and execute it again.",啊我们的示例音频文件在它的上一层目录，可以将其保存，然后再次执行。
"If your networking works well, you can get the recognition results of these audio files: Baidu Speech offers technical supports.",哎如果你的网络正常，就可以得到这些音频文件的识别结果——百度语音提供技术支持。
"For other languages, you can refer to the sample.",呃其他语言大家可以参考示例工程。
There are some samples of java and C++. ,呃现在我们有java和C++的一些示例。
"Similarly, if you use python or other languages, you can write a script based on the interface of htp independently.",啊同样你如果使用python或者其他的啊语言，你也可以自行呃根据hp htp的接口进行编写。
We have displayed the recognition interface of REST API which can only handle real-time audio files.,刚才我们演示的REST API的识别接口，啊REST API只能处理实时的音频文件。
"If you want to achieve the recognition of audio stream, you need to leverage SDK.",如果要实现音频流的识别，就需要借助SDK了。
We also have a sample for Android which can be used to demonstrate automated speech recognition and voice wake-up.,在我们的示例工程里面，同样也有一个啊安卓的示例工程，这个工程是用来演示语音识别和唤醒的。
Import this sample into the development tool and then run it.,那我们将这个工程导入到开发工具里边，然后嗯将其运行。
"Afterward, let us look at the phone. ",运行之后，我们回到手机里边看一下。
"Click ""Regular mode"", ""Start"" and then ""Record Speech"".",我们直接点击“普通模式”，点击“开始”，啊我们点击“允许录音”。
"""How's the weather tomorrow?""",“明天天气怎么样？”
"""What's the weather like the day after tomorrow"".",“后天天气怎么样？”
"Different from the recognition interface of REST API, we can see the result as we speak.",啊与REST API 的识别接口不同的是，我们一边说话就能看到识别结果。
This is something that REST API cannot do.,而REST API是做不到的。
"As a result, for products running on Android and IOS, SDK must be used.",所以我们建议啊安卓、IOS这样端上的产品，呃一定要使用SDK 。
"As the final part of the video, I will share with you a voice technology product.",最后我们看一个语音产品的案例。
"In this case, automated speech recognition, voice wake-up and Text-to-Speech will all be involved.",在这个案例里边，语音识别唤醒和合成都将被用到。
Now let us see what the product can do.,好，那我们现在就看功能展示。
"""Search for tomorrow’s weather through Baidu Search Engine""",“百度一下明天的天气”
"""Navigate to the New Baidu Edifice""",“导航到百度新大厦”
"""Search for a badminton racket on Taobao""",“淘宝搜索羽毛球拍”
"""Open Wechat""",“打开微信”
"""Download Baidu Waimai""",“下载百度外卖”
"""Call China Unicom""",“打电话给联通”
"Now, let’s analyze the functions of this software and the way they are achieved. ",现在我们分析一下这款软件的功能和实现。
This software supports the function of monitoring and making telephone calls. ,这款这款软件呢能够监听导航，打电话。
"Apart from this, there is also Nuomi, of whom the prefix serves as a wake word.",啊以及糯米搜索之类的这种前缀关键词，用这些关键词作为唤醒词。
"Once hearing these words, this software will initiate a recognition task which matches these prefix words with the targeting content in the search engine. ",一旦监听到这些词之后，将会立即启动一个识别任务，并且将这些前缀关键词和后面识的识别内容一同交给识别引擎进行识别。
Then we can get a recognition result of a text which will be analyzed to call a specific application.,识别之后得到一个呃文本的识别结果，然后将这个文本的识结果识别结果加以分析，啊最后调取特定的应用。
"If it is an instruction to make a phone call, it will be handled by the calling module to initiate the function of making a phone call.",如果是打电话类的指令，那就啊交给打电话的模块，让系统的打电话功能去呃调启打电话的功能。
"And if you want to search for something, it will open the Baidu Search Engine through the browser.",如果说的是搜索什么东西，就直接通过浏览器打开百度搜索。
"Of course, if you want to download or use other functions of Nuomi, their corresponding applications will be initiated as long as they are covered in the program. ",那当然如果是糯米下载，和一些其它的，只要能够程序里边有的功能都将调启指定的呃应用。
"Given the limited time of this lesson, I will not demonstrate the specific codes here. ",由于这节课程的时间比较短，我就不在这里展示代码啦呐。
"However, I will upload the complete codes of this product to GitHub, and the specific link can be found in the attachment of this lesson.",但是我会将这个产品用到这个代码啊完整的上传到GitHub，具体的链接可以在课程的附件里面进行查找。
"That is all for today's lesson, we discussed the relevant technologies of Text-to-Speech and automated speech recognition, and we demonstrated a sample.",今天的课程就给大家介绍到这里，在今天的课程中给大家演示了语音合成和识别的相关技术，并展示了一个实例。
"If you want to know more details of Baidu voice technologies, please contact us via our email or web site.",如果大家想获取更多百度语音相关的技术知识的，可以通过邮箱或网址联系到我们。

"""Dao"" is in fact easy to grasp.",道，其实蛮简单。
How exactly?,它简单到什么程度呢？
It is so easy that it is kinda funny.,事实上简单到一个蛮有趣的程度去。
"Let's look at the word ""Zen"".",我们回头再去看看这一个“禅”。
"The word ""Zen"" was borrowed actually.",禅，事实上是一个外来语。
"""Zen"" is not Chinese, it is rather a loanword from the Aryan, according to my mother.",我们知道，“禅”不是中国话，我妈妈说的话“禅”这个字其实是从雅利安文所转来的。
"With the foreign pronunciation of ""Zen"", our Chinese ancestors invented the word.",这个音不是咱们中文，这个字是中国人自己把它创出来的。
"Each Chinese character symbolizes in fact a image, just like the icon on our computers, our phone, especially our smart phones.",而中文每一个字都是我们今天电脑，我们手机，尤其智慧型手机上面的icon，叫i-c-o-n，每一个icon就是每一个的图案。
"As we all know, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, their war is in fact mainly about the creation of icon, which could easily translate into valuable asset, just as Chinese characters do.",而我们都知道，比尔·盖茨也好，或者是Steve Jobs，他们两个人的战争，其实主要是争夺谁发明了icon，而icon它是一个那么简单的可以激活非常多价值的一个出入口，而每一个中文字确实如此。
"For example, the character ""Zen"" is simple, yet we could write 50 thousand books to explain it.",譬如“禅”，简单，你可以写五万本书来解释“禅”一个字。
"But for ""Zen"", what our mothers, our ancestors did is to use their heart to explain this character.",但是“禅”，我们的祖先，我们的妈妈她们用的是心。
"With only efforts but no heart, a successful life would be in vain.",如果没有心，只有努力，人生的成功也不会有意义。
Then the Chinese people would be a tragedy for the society and for the world!,那中国人对于社会对于世界来说应该继续是个灾难！
"People say there are four villain countries in the world, and one of which we always refuse to admit.",这个世界上有四个流氓国家，常常被提的时候后面还有一个谁都不说出来。
"The problem is, if we don't behave with a kind heart and we don't follow the philosophy of Confucius that ""To honor the aged people of other families as we treat our own; to care for the children of others' as we do to our own"", then we are not caring.",问题来了，如果我们做任何事情不用心，不会用孔子说的，我们“幼吾幼以及人之幼，老吾老以及人之老”。
"Just as if we don't care if other people's mother, grandmother or grandfather is hit by a car or if other children was died in a car accident.",别人的妈妈，别人的奶奶，别人的祖父被车撞了我们也不会去管他，别人家的孩子被车撞死了我也不去管他，那么这个东西呢，坦白说是不用心。
"Although the word ""Zen"" is originally Aryan, what it wants to say is be simple.",所以“禅”虽然从雅利安人转来的这么个字，它要的是简单。
"To act simple and think simple with your heart, this is ""Zen"".",是用心简单，用心简单地想，用心简单地做，这就叫“禅”。
"Similarly, the ""Zen spirits"", ""Zen style"", ""Zen master"", ""Zen philosophy"", there are nothing complicated about them.",其实，禅意、禅风、禅师、禅道，里面真的没有太多麻烦的事情。
"Apart from ""Zen"", are there other borrowed words?",那么有哪些东西可以告诉我们说这个“禅”这个外来语，还有相关的一些哪些东西呢？
"I prepared some interesting characters, such as ""Ye"" and ""fo"" which is also borrowed.",我准备了一些蛮有趣的，譬如说“业”、譬如说“佛”，“佛”这个字也是外来语。
"Upon my study, I concluded that of 1,800 Chinese characters, about 300 of which are Banana language.",那么我经过研究1800个字里面的中文大概有300个字是这一种芭蕉文。
Banana language is words with yellow skin and a Chinese vibe while the content is borrowed from other cultures.,芭蕉文的意思就是外面是黄的是咱们中国人的，这是我们中文，但是里面呢是从外面传来的。
"We all know that the Aryan people are ancestors of Sakyamuni, who is not asian but white with white curly hair.",大家都知道，雅利安人也就是释迦摩尼的祖先，他是白人，释迦摩尼不是黄种人，他是一个白颜色完全白颜色卷头发的白种人。
There is an interesting phenomenon in the process of word borrowing in China: the words imported or exported were more postive during the prosperous time of China.,那么这些转进来到我们中国的时候呢，很有趣的一个现象，中国是越强盛的时候，我们传进来跟引出去的话就越漂亮。
"As China began to decline, we became more unconfident and self-pitying.",那到了中国国势越来越衰退，越没有自信，越看不起自己的时候呢。
The words exported were more or less negative.,传出去的话全都是比较负面的。
I found some instances in this case.,所以我从这个地方当然也看到了一些别的字，这些字大概是在这里。
"""Tea"" for example, was introduced from China to the world.",我们来瞧瞧，像“茶”，茶这个字其实是从中文从中国传到了全世界。
"It is called ""Tea"" in English.",英文叫什么，叫tea。
"""Tea"" pronounces the same way as ""Die"" in Southern Fujian Dialect and Hakka.",tea其实在闽南语在客家里就叫“die”。
"So this is where ""Tea"" came from.",其实就是tea。
By far I have found as many as about 400 Chinese words along with their pronunciations exported and populated in all corners of the world.,有非常多的字，有多少呢，有四百个字，我现在已经找到的，咱们中国字，中国的音，中国的意传到了世界各地。
These words are lingua franca indeed.,变成了世界各地的通用语。
"Let's say the word ""China"", which we all know.",譬如说china，china我们都知道是什么。
"It's a porcelain or the country of China, isn't?",瓷器或者是中国，是吧？
"China is the country name, but we know it's a Chinese character, nor an English word or a porcelain at all.",China是中国，但实际上我们都知道，这是一个中文，它不是china，它不是瓷器。
"If we could read and understand the words and language of our mothers, we would know that the word ""China"" came from an ancient town in Jiangxi Province, north of Jingdezhen, south of the Changhe River.",刚好相反，如果我们读得懂妈妈的话，看得懂妈妈写的字，我们就明白了，china其实它是今天江西有一个古镇，它就在景德镇的北面，也就是昌河的南边。
The town names Changnan.,那个古镇叫做昌南。
Changnan was the then world-renowned town of hi-tech products.,昌南是全世界当时卖高科技的重镇。
Porcelains were rarity back then.,瓷器是全世界引以为傲。
A porcelain then equalizes an iPad today.,拥有一个等于今天拥有一个苹果的iPad。
"Porcelains were then hi-tech in the world, whoever wanted one should go to Changnan!",瓷器在全世界是一个非常高科技的东西，谁想来买，去哪里买，昌南古镇！
"Despite the change of dynasties and countries, Changnan remained intact there.",不管你换了多少朝代，不管你换了多少国家名称，这个地方就叫昌南。
"Over time, where did foreigners who craved for porcelains go?",所以久而久之，所有全世界外国人想要去买这个东西的人去哪里呢？
Changnan!,昌南！
"Hence the word ""China"".",所以china。
"Changnan was a major porcelain producer, so it is called ""China"", so the English of ""China"" actually came from China.",而这个东西因为这个地方产的特别多，所以它叫瓷器，所以瓷器是因为昌南古镇而来，china英文也是从中文而来。
"Another interesting thing is that we found lots of characters that are exported from China, we call it the ""Duck egg words"".",所以蛮有趣的事情是我们看见有蛮多的字，这边都是中文的输出语，我们叫它鸭蛋语。
Altogether there're over 400 duck egg words.,那这四百多个鸭蛋语里面，也挺有趣的。
"Take ""Casino"" for example, what does it mean?",譬如说casino，casino叫什么？
Casino means a gambling house.,casino，赌场。
So is it an English word?,那赌场是不是英文？
Perhaps some foreigners would regard it as a pure English word.,呃我们外国的朋友们可能认为casino当然是英文。
"But now we know that the word ""Casino"" was created by Chinese workers from Fujian and Guangdong who were sent to America to build railways.",但现在我们都知道，casino是因为当时华工，福建人，广东人大量的被送到美国去建造美国大铁路的时候。
"They would shout ""Here we go"" that sounds like ""Casino"" in Cantonese, before getting off work.",他们还没下班呢他们就会开始喊“开始喽，开始喽”。
Then what were they going to do?,开始做什么东西啊？
Gambling.,开始去赌博。
"Hence the word ""Casino"".",所以赌博叫casino。
"In fact, we know for sure ""Casino"" was exported to western world from China, I have not talked about the numerous cases of word borrowing from China to Japan, to South Korea, to Thailand or to Vietnam.",事实上casino是一个绝对从中国传到了西方，我还没有去举一个例子譬如说多少的语言是从中国传到了日本，传到了韩国，传到了泰国，传到了越南。
We have found more than 400 English words that were borrowed from Chinese.,我们单单从英文这个地方已经找到四百多个字其实都是中文传出去了。
So if we have enough time and I hope it would be 10 or 20 years for me.,所以如果我们有时间，我个人希望用个十年二十年时间。
I would be 90 in 20 years.,二十年以后我大概是九十岁。
"I'm getting 70 this year and my mother 104, so I believe I still have a long life ahead.",因为我我今年是快70了，我母亲104，所以我相信我还有一个蛮长的岁月可以去过。
"I've encountered twice air accident, one of which killed 76 passengers.",当然我因为摔过两次飞机，那么有一次摔下来的时候有七十六个人当场死亡。
I survived.,我自己没摔死。
"So I know when I cross the street, there is a chance of getting hit by a car.",那么所以我知道我过马路有时候也可能知道会被撞死。
"Putting accidents aside, I think we should make a long term plan for ourselves.",所以如果没有一些意外的话，我相信我们每一个人都应该替自己留一个比较长的愿景。
"When you're devoted to something, you'd find what your mother said was true.",而这个愿景当每一个人都愿意去认真去做一件事情的时候，我蛮相信我妈妈说的话。
I can also understand more thoroughly all the sense my mother talked about.,我妈妈说的道理，我会懂得更多一点。
"With this, more people would be attracted to other Chinese characters.",那么大家以后呢对这个字也可能会多一点兴趣。
To hold your attention I'd like to show you the changes of numbers.,好，接下来，事实上为了让大家有兴趣，看看数字的变化。
"We all know these numbers and we write in Arabic numberals, don't we?",那么这些字，我们都知道，呃各位写阿拉伯数字对不对？
We use them all day without knowing that how long we Chinese people have been using them.,阿拉伯数字每个人都在写，那么事实上咱们中国人写这些数字呢其实也有很长的时间。
"At the end of the Zhou Dynasty, Chinese numbers have been divided into 8 categories, passing down everywhere in the country.",就在周朝的末年，其实那段时间呢中国的字已经分成了八种数字，那这八种数字中间有一些流传在这里，有些流传在那里。
"For instance, people in Suzhou had their own way of writing, which was actually inherited from the way back in the Wu State.",譬如苏州就有一些自己的苏州特别的写法，而这个数字其实在吴国的时候就已经传下来了。
"In the screen you could see that on the very top is what people in Suzhou wrote, ""Suzhou numerals"" and most Chinese merchants were using them.",那么传下来以后我们看见这个阿拉伯数字最上面这个苏州码子，苏州他们是这么写的，而中国的商人基本上都用这个数字在做的。
We also have computer language which is equally interesting.,除此之外我们也看见了我们的电脑文，我们也看到非常有趣的一些文字。
"At the bottom we could see PALM, the PDA is composed of lines.","那么如果我们用PALM,PDA大概就可以看到最后那一行是一笔画。"
So the question is where were Arabic numerals originally came from?,问题是我们现在写的阿拉伯文字的原生地从哪里来呢？
It would be fun to know the birth place.,我们都知道这个原生地蛮有趣的。
So where?,从什么地方来？
People say it is Arabian.,都说是阿拉伯。
"But why Arabic numerals had to be look like 1, 2, and 3?",但是阿拉伯数字，为什么1是1，2是2，3是3？
"We now know that all numbers and words, Chinese words included, must come from somewhere, and that's essential.",我们现在明白了，所有的数字，所有的文字，包括咱们中国这些所有的字，它都有来源，而且那个来源看起来都很重要。
"From the numbers we could deduce that Arabic numerals weren't from the Arab countries, it was the Indians who invented these numbers.",所以我们借着这个数字来往前看看，问题是阿拉伯数字不是来自于阿拉伯，阿拉伯数字是来自印度，是印度人发明了这个字。
"However, if you still recall what I have talked about earlier, you would find it interesting where came the Indian numbers.",而刚刚前一页，如果各位认真在去看的话，很有趣的一件事情，印度的数字又从哪儿来呢。
From China!,中国！
"We think that the numbers we're writing are Arabic, and even the whole world name it Arabic numerals.",我们一直以为我们写的叫阿拉伯字，全世界说这个东西叫阿拉伯文。
"Unfortunately, they were brought by Arabian sailors from India.",对不起，从印度传进去的，是阿拉伯人航海的时候把它带进去的。
"If you dig further, you will find that there were already numbers 3000 years ago in China, then you will see that these numerals were exported from China.",但是如果你非常认真地再去看看中国已经留下来三千多年前就已经有了数字，那你就明白了，这个数字弄了半天是从中国传出去的。
"So why ""1"" looks like this?",那么1为什么是1呢？
"Because ""1"" has only one angle.",1因为有一个角。
"I suggest you all to look at ""2"", how many angles then?",各位可以算算看2有几个角，2有几个角？
"Yes, two.",两个角。
"What about ""3""?",那3呢？
How many angles now?,3我们看看，有几个角，几个角？
Three.,三个角。
"And ""4""?",4呢？
Four of course.,四个角。
"And ""5""?",5呢？
"And ""6""?",6呢？
"And ""7""?",7呢？
"Please note that many people still write the number ""7"" this way, which is exactly the same as ancient Chinese did.",记住，很多人写7是这样写的，这个7的写法跟原来咱们中国字一模一样。
"But Indians didn't write that way, if you recall the numbers in last page.",原来的印度文7不是这样写的，我们在上一页有些东西。
"So if you find all this interesting, you could download my slides and study at home.",所以如果大家有兴趣可以把我的这个呃这个PPT那么把它拷回来，收回去，然后慢慢去研究它。
"Alright, here's the number ""8"", oops, where is ""8""?",好，8，当然就是，诶，我的8跑哪儿去了？
"Where is the number ""8""?",8嘞？
"Ok, here's ""8"".",OK，8来了。
It has 8 angles for sure.,8有八个角。
"Finally the number ""9"" with 9 angles.",自然9也有九个角。
It's called cloud-shaped writing in China.,9的写法是咱们中国的叫云形写法。
"When we visit Chinese temples in the Imperial Palace in Beijing or the National Palace Museum in Taipei, we would find numerous symbols and structures in a cloud-form.",事实上我们如果去看所有中国的庙宇，到故宫去看，到台北的故宫去看，很多东西，它全都是这种叫云形图案。
"Such patterns means ""9"" that suggests immortality or longevity in Chinese.",这种图案就是九的意思，就是长长久久的意思。
But only one place is allowed to put these auspicious patterns.,只有什么地方可以放这东西呢？
The imperial palace!,皇宫！
Ordinary people were forbidden to use it.,老百姓是不能用的。
"Therefore it's called ""9"" because of its 9 angles in writing.",所以这个数字一共有九个角，所以它叫9。
"Last but not least, the number ""0"". It's called zero as it has no angle at all.",当然，0因为一个角都没有，所以它叫零。
"The origins of these numbers were found and used by our great ancestors, our mothers back in 3,000 years ago.",而这个字的原形，三千年前，咱们的妈妈们她们已经找到了，她们已经会用了。
"As descendants, we survived 100-year-long wartime such as the First Sino-Japanese War, the First Opium  War and the Siege of the International Legations, we have been seeking a new path.",所以我觉得我们这些子孙，那么经过了这一百多年来甲午战争也好，再前面的鸦片战争也好，八国联军也好，其实大家都在摸索一条新的出路。
"Today China's GDP growth ranks the second in the world, and by 2030 China would lead the world by its currency.",问题是中国现在GDP已经上来了，2030年中国要带领一个亚洲货币。
It is not a dream.,但也不是梦。
The question is where is our culture?,问题来了，我们的文化在哪里？
Earlier tonight I listened to some former lectures talked about Chinese morality.,我前面呃我坐在下面听了呃上面几位先生说到了咱们中国人道德在哪里。
Could we listen carefully and understand the words of our mothers?,我们能不能从母亲的话里面听懂一些道理？
Could we really learn something from the language of our mothers?,我们可不可以从母亲的字里面，找到一些道理？
"If we could earnestly try to understand, to learn, to respect our ancestors and their heritage, I think there will be a new path for Chinese people.",如果我们认真地去理解跟尊重我们的祖先而不要把他革命掉，蛮重要的是中国可以走新的路。
A new China would definitely set out at that beginning.,新兴中国显然会从这个地方可以重新出发。
"So, it is important to listen to the ""Dao"".",所以，听“道”我们认为很重要。
How to listen and understand?,如何的听得懂？
How to behave?,如何的行得懂？
How to do your work properly?,如何把所有的工作做得非常上道？
These are the things that need to be elaborated at TnDao tonight.,这个大概是我们今天晚上听道所必须要往下再去延续的。
Thank you very much for giving me the precious 15 minutes to share with you some extraordinary ideas in ordinary words.,所以非常高兴今天有这么个机会用十五分钟的时间跟大家来分享一下非常道里面的寻常话。
Ordinary words with extraordinary ideas.,寻常话，非常道。

"We hope that innovative applications could flourish in this ecosystem, which could benefit us all with AI-infused capabilites.",再从而能够在这个生态上长出各种各样的创新的应用，来真正的把AI让它普惠到社会上的每一个人。
"OK, next I will talk about Baidu Open AI Platform in detail.",好，下面我详细地说一下这个百度AI开放平台。
"Up to now, this platform has opened more than 80 capabilites. ",在这个平台之上，目前，我们已经开放了八十多项能力，
"Some can be directly used, some are going through public or private beta testing, and others will be made available in the near future.",有可以直接使用的，也也有正在邀测和公测的，还有近期即将开放的。
Theses functions can be classified into three layers.,纵观整个能力，主要分为三层。
"The first is the framework layer, which is PaddlePaddle, an deep learning platform developed by Baidu.",首先是计算框架层，也就是我们百度自主研发的深度学习平台 PaddlePaddle。
PaddlePaddle is now a open-source platform. ,我们把这个PaddlePaddle完成了开源，
It is the fundamental framework and the source of the development of all capabilites.,它是所有打造所有能力的一个框架、一个源泉。
Then there are scenario-based machine learning capabilites.,在这之上是场景化的能力。

"I believe that PaddlePaddle is the most comprehensive platform countrywide, even worldwide.",包括国内或国外，我觉得没有我们是最全面的平台，没有之一。
Above PaddlePaddle is our solution layer.,在这之上，是我们的解决方案层。
"The solution layer is not only an integration of all capabilites, but also a program that has been thoroughly optimized based on every scenario. ",解决方案层不仅是各项能力的综合，而且是我们基于每一个场景，深度打磨的这么一个方案，
It can be used by our developers and partners.,能够很方便地供我们的开发者和合作伙伴使用。
"Now I will briefly introduce the capabilities on each layer. First of all, PaddlePaddle.",好，下面我会分层对各个层面的能力进行一个概要的介绍，首先是PaddlePaddle。
The goal of PaddlePaddle is to become the deep learning platform that meets best the need of developers in China.,PaddlePaddle的目标就是做最符合中国开发者需要的深度学习平台。
"First, it understands best Chinese. Why?",首先，它最懂中文处理，为什么？
Because it is deeply rooted in China and benefits from the profound experience that Baidu has acquired in processing Chinese for over a decade. ,因为它深耕于中国的业务，而且凭借百度这十几年在中文处理方面的深厚的积累，
Now PaddlePaddle makes it available in the form of source code.,把这些积累以源码的形式开放出去。
"Second, it satisfies best the needs of Chinese enterprises.",其次，它最符合中国企业的需要。
"We know that data is the means of production of AI, and data security may be what most Chinese companies are concerned about.",我们知道，数据是人工智能的生产资料，而数据安全是每一个可能是大部分中国企业比较关注的。
Our PaddlePaddle offers standalone deployment and distributed deployment to help companies secure their data.,而我们的PaddlePaddle能够提供单机的私有化部署，或者是多机的分布式的部署，完全可以部署到企业中，来确保数据的安全。
"Third, it suits Chinese developers best, because it was developed by Chinese developers, right?",第三，它是最符合中国开发者的，因为它就是中国开发者开发出来的，对吧？
Only what's unique to a nation can be precious to the world. ,就是只有先作为民族的才能走向才是世界的。
"While constantly opening up various technologies and source code, we also developed deep learning curriculum according to the current technological context, so as to help our developers and engineers make more progress.",好，不断开放了技术和源码，我们还针对这个现在人工智能的时代开发了深深度学习的课程，来辅助我们的开发者和工程师成长。
We know that AI is another major opportunity for developers in the way the past era of mobile devices rallied a large group of Android and IOS engineers. ,我们知道，人工智能是开发者的又一大机遇，就像当年的移动时代，安卓工程师、IOS工程师一样，
"Our own curriculum, along with those we developed together with Jike Xuyuan(literally translate to 'Geek Acadamy'), intends to help our developers and engineers become AI engineers.",我们自己开发的课程，包括和极客学院一起打造的课程，来助力我们的开发者和工程师成长为人工智能的工程师。
Then let’s talk about facial recognition technology.,好，下面是人脸技术。
"Our facial recognition offers not only basic capabilities such as face and body recognition, face liveness detection, face comparison, face search, etc., but also solutions optimized based on region scenarios.",我们人脸技术不仅开放了人体人脸检测、活体检测、人脸对比、人脸查找等基础能力，而且，还开放了地域场景打磨的我们的解决方案。
"These solutions include AFR-enabled ID verificaton, AFR-enabled sign-in, which you have seen when you came in, membership verification through face recognition that you saw in the promo video, and the auto-gate solution enabled by face recognition.",比如人脸核身的解决方案，比如会场签到的解决方案，就像刚才大家进来时候这个签到用的那个一整套的方案，再有就是人脸会员识别的解决方案，刚才宣传片上大家应该也已经看到了，再有就是人脸闸机的解决方案。
"Wu Yanyu, one of my co-workers, will give you a more detailed introduction later of these solutions and basic capabilities, so I won’t go into details here.",这些方案和基础能力，一会儿我的同事吴延宇会做一个详细的介绍，我在这里就不详细地展开了。
"In short, we made face technology available with the goal to make every face recognizable.",总之，我们开放人脸技术的目的就是让天下没有难看的脸。
"Next, our advanced text recognition.",下面是领先的文字识别。
"It is fair to say that Baidu's text recognition may be the most advanced technology in the industry, way ahead of its competitors.",可以说百度的文字识别是全领域最领先的，最呃大大领先于竞品。
And text recognition consists of several capabilites.,而文字识别又有几个能力。
"First, the capability of general text recognition. ",首先是通用文字识别的能力，
"The second is card recognition, including ID cards, bank cards, driving licenses, vehicle licenses, etc. ",再一个就是卡证识别，包括身份证、银行卡、驾照、行驶证等等等等这些卡证类，
"Third, web image recognition, which entails the recognition of wordart. ",再有一个就是网络图片的识别，就是这种各个艺术字啊等等，
"The fourth is the table and form recognition, which can adequately recognize and reproduce structured data in scanned copies. ",还有就是表格文字识别，就像我们表格的这种扫描件，它都能很好地进行识别和还原成这个结构化的数据，
It also be used in receipt recognition.,呃再有就是票据识别等等。
"Well, let's take an example.",我们来看，举个例子。
"First,  common typefaces can be well recognized by line.",首先，对于这种正常的印刷体，我们能够很好地逐行地去识别。
"And wordart and distorted characters in web images, can also be properly recognized.",再有，就是这种含有艺术字的网络图片，还有异形的这种网络图片上的文字我们都能进行一个很好的识别，而且效果非常好。
"Moreover, information on tickets and receipts can be identified by line with perfect accuracy.",再有，就是票据，我们也能逐行给它识别出来，效果可以说是完美。
"In addition to these general capabilities, we will also open the customized OCR templates in the near future, because we not only have to identify the characters correctly, but also reproduce the fields as you wish.",除了这些通用的能力，那我们近期还会开放个性化模板的OCR，因为我们不仅要识别出正确的字，而且要返回你关心的字段。
"For example, here we have a medical bill.",比如，举个例子，这是一张医疗的票据。
The first one is a template customized by the user.,第一张是用户自定义的模板，
" After the user defines the fields and values ​that he or she wants to use, we upload a new medical bill. ",他关心哪些字段和哪些值，定义好之后我们上传一张新的医疗票据，
The one in the middle was taken and uploaded by a mobile phone.,中间那张就是用手机拍摄上传的。
We use AI-infused algorithms and image transformation to extract the subject we want to identify. ,我们用一些人工智能的算法、图像变换，给它截取出我们待识别的主体，
"Meanwhile, we identify the fields that the user wants to use, restructure and return them to a document.",同时，我们识别出来它关心的字段，并且给它结构化到文档中返回，

"And I told the culture secretary of Ningbo that even if Liang Shanbo was truly an upright official, people will not buy into this fact, because they prefer he was a poor scholar.",而且梁祝我同宁波的文化局长讲，即使他是个清官，老百姓也不会认可他，他们宁可希望是一个穷秀才。
This is how Chinese people think of the story of these two tragic lovers in their hearts.,啊，所以这个是我们被全中国人民认可的一个心目中间的梁祝。
This tragic yet profound story signifies the relentless pursuit of love and courageous fight against evils by these two lovers.,而作为这个梁祝故事后面的道是什么呢？就是他们对爱的不朽的哈那种执着的追求和对恶势力的反抗。
"In the end of this legendary story, they proved their love and spirit by transforming into butterflies.",而这一点在梁祝的传说里面，集中地表现在化蝶里面。
"Meng bo, the then deputy President and party secretary, once said, ""Why not make reference to their transforming into butterflies? The transformation makes their resistance even more romantic.""",当时我们的副院长党委书记孟波先生，他就讲为什么不化蝶呢？化蝶是更浪漫的反抗。
"Therefore, as we composed this concerto, instead of narrating a tragic story like Romeo and Juliet's death, we added the section ""lovers transforming into butterflies"" into the concerto.",所以当时我们跨过了这个讲故事的框框，啊也跨过罗密欧朱丽叶这样的殉情的结束，写了化蝶。
"Only afterwards did we realize that ""transforming into butterflies"" was the true essence of “The Butterfly Lovers”, deftly symbolizing Chinese people's feverish pursuit of love.",写完了以后我们发觉，化蝶才是梁祝的精神，啊才是梁祝所表现的中国人对爱情的那种道，那种追求。
"Now, let me play the section of ""transforming into butterflies"" to all of you.",那么现在我就弹一段化蝶给大家听。
This melody is my interpretation of the spirit of this epic story.,我想这个就是我对梁祝的所有的解释，都在音乐中间，啊。
"As I have mentioned earlier, love, together with music, art, soul and beauty, is beyond our ability to analyze or interpret.",所所以就是我刚才讲的，爱情同音乐还有同艺术，同灵魂同美一样，都是不可分析、不可解释的。
It is universal but cannot be fathomed.,都是道可道非常道，不可道之大道也。
"On this account, love is something we can only pursue or experience but cannot analyze.",所以我们对于爱只能够靠拢它，可以感受它，但是我们很难分析它。
"Hence, it is difficult for me to understand why the philosophy of love of today's young people hinges on how tall her/her lover is, and whether she/he has a big house or a large amount of assets.",所以我很难理解现在我们的很多年轻人，他们有个爱情的计划表，我的对象身高多少，有没有房子，有没有财产。
"After the great reform and opening up, many believe that the legend of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai is irrational.",这个改革开放以后啊，很多人认为梁祝这个传说是不合理的。
Liang Shanbo is such a smart scholar and Zhu Yingtai such a beautiful girl.,啊，你想梁山伯那么聪明一个秀才，旁边那么漂亮个女孩子。
How could he not recognize she was a girl after three years together.,怎么会三年不知道她是女孩子呢。
"This is definitely irrational, let alone ""transforming into butterflies"".",就显然不合理的，对吧，化蝶是更不合理的。
"At that time, some wiseacres even proposed to replace the traditional story of “The Butterfly Lovers” with a new one featuring a smarter Liang Shanbo who fell in love with Zhu Yingtai at first sight.",所以呢那个时候就有些聪明人啊，要把梁山伯祝英台改成个新梁祝，改成个聪明的梁山伯，他看到祝英台一见钟情，热烈拥抱。
"Nevertheless, all most all audiences did not like this smarter version of Liang Shanbo.",很奇怪，所有的观众他不认可这个聪明的梁山伯。
"On the contrary, they preferred the nerdy one.",他宁可要这个傻里傻气的。
Why?,啊这为什么？
There is an aesthetic question.,这个里面是有一个美学的问题。
"This legend, though irrational, would not be appealing to us if it became rational.",梁祝的传说是不合理的，但是变成合理的以后呢，就不合情了。
"Based on the modern criteria of dating, Zhu Yingtai would marry Ma Wencai and Liang Shanbo would never have a chance.",现在我们这个年轻人找对象，这个祝英台绝对不会嫁给梁山伯，一定嫁给马文才，哈哈。
"In this legend, Liang Shanbo is an impoverished scholar.",这个，呃这个传说里面梁山伯又是一个穷秀才。
"However, it is the very romance between a poor man like Liang Shanbo and a beautiful woman like Zhu Yingtai that we need the most.",但是越是在这个时候越需要梁山伯，越需要祝英台，越说明我们内心的深处有一个很高的美学的追求。
"This could testify to the noble, pure and enduring aesthetic wish deeply embedded in our hearts to pursue love and beauty.",是吧，追求那种很纯真的，这个那种执着的爱。
So I believe this also represents a noble mindset.,所以我想这个也是一种很高的一个境界。
I suppose love is a legend and a sort of creativity.,所以我想着爱情呢，它是一种传说，也是一种创造。
"The world is in need of constant creativity, so is love.",因为我们生活的每一天它都在不断地创造，爱情也是需要不断地创造不断地创造。
"You may have noticed that Picasso, the great painter, whose last wife was 35 years younger than him.",你注意没有Picasso，那么伟大的画家，他最后的那个妻子是比他小35岁。
"Charlie Chaplin, the great comic actor, was also 35 years older than Oona, his last wife.",卓别林，伟大的戏剧家，他最后的妻子叫乌娜，也比他小35岁。
Were the preference of a young pretty wife and the fickle affection of human nature the reason for a happily ever after?,难道他们仅仅是因为喜新厌旧、年轻漂亮，啊最后他们很圆满地结合在一起啦？
I've had my doubts.,我说我曾经这样怀疑过。
But I can now conclude that my doubts were wrong and I want to present an important idea that young wives can indeed accompany these ideological leaders going forward in the realm of art.,但是我否定啦，我觉得最重要的一点，就是艺术家他们他的思想永远在往前面走的，而那个年轻的妻子可以跟他同步地前进。
"Of course, choosing to be an old married couple also has its saving graces.",当然老夫老妻也很好啊，那个那个老夫老妻她会说。
"For example, your wife might kindheartedly remind you to add some clothes when it gets cold or eat more food when you are hungry.",你今天凉了加一件衣服啊，或者说回头饿了加一个饭啊。
"This is indeed warm and sweet, but how could she possibly manage to know you are growing and evolving in your heart as an artist.",很好，但是她可能不知道这个艺术家在怎么发展，是吧。
"On this ground, I assume that love is an eternal process of creation.",所以我想真正的爱情，应该是永远创造的。
Your lover is a never ending book which you have to read incessantly in an endless attempt to catch up with his mindset.,你所爱的人永远是一本读不完的一本活页的书，她啊她也不断地增加，不断地更新，这样才可以。
"Next, I will introduce two songs to you, one called Beside The Suzhou River and the another Everlasting Smile, all composed by my father, Chen Gexin.",下面呢我要介绍两首歌，一首叫《苏州河边》，还有一首是《永远的微笑》，都是我父亲陈歌辛写的。
"You may not be acquainted with Chen Gexin, but you must have heard of Rose, Rose, I Love You, Shanghai Nights, Gong Xi Gong Xi, and Beside The Suzhou River.",你们可能不知道陈歌辛是谁，但是你们一定知道《玫瑰玫瑰我爱你》，一定知道《夜上海》，一定知道《恭喜恭喜》，一定知道《苏州河边》。
All these wonderful songs were composed by him.,啊，都是他写的。
"In my opinion, these are two songs about love.",那么我想这个两个都是很好的表现爱情的歌。
Beside The Suzhou River describes the story of two lovers walking alongside the Suzhou River.,《苏州河边》是一对情人啊，在苏州河边走的时候。
The first singer to sing the song was Yao Li who is now 91 and still lives in Hong Kong.,那个第一个唱的叫姚莉，姚莉阿姨现在还在香港，91岁。
"She often recalls the time when working with my father. After finishing recording songs in the recording factory, they would take a walk on the banks of the Suzhou River.",她常常回忆这段故事，她说那个时候她同我爸爸两人在唱片场录好音出来以后，就在苏州河边走。
"As depicted in the song, ""Watch you look at me as I look at you; thousands of words are expressed in silence"".",就像歌词里面讲的，你望着我我望着你，千言万语变作沉默。
How romantic is that!,要多美的一个意境啊。
"Though undeclared, the affection to each other is deftly sprinkled within this romantic song.",那个时候都没说出来的爱啊，就千你望着我望着你，千言万语化作沉默，这是一首情歌。
"The another one, Everlasting Smile, was a love song my father wrote for my mother.",另外一首《永远的微笑》，是我父亲写给我母亲的一首情歌。
"As the song goes, ""oh, my sweetheart, how beautiful you smiling face is….""",啊叫心上的人儿，有笑的脸脸庞。
My father said my mother looked like Mona Lisa blessed with an everlasting smile.,他说我妈妈长得像蒙娜丽莎，啊有永远的微笑啊。
"As the written in the song, ""The everlasting smile makes me feel like in spring while in autumn and gives me sunlight while in darkness.""",她能在深秋给我春光，她能在啊黑夜呃给我太阳。
"The middle of the poem reads ""I cannot lose the only spring and sun I have."" This, to some extent, looks likes a prophecy of tragedy.",然后他中间一段呢好像是一个悲剧的预言，说我不能够失去我仅有的春光，我也不能失去我仅有的太阳。
"Unfortunately, in 1957, my father was labeled as one of the alleged ""rightists"" and was therefore forced to leave home and died shortly afterwards.",因为后来我父亲很不幸地在五七年被打成右派，他离开了家里，很早就去世了。
This is how the prophecy came true.,然后他就预言了他这个悲剧的命运。
"The last two lines of the song are "" My sweet heart, do not be filled with sorrow. May you live happily with an everlasting smile"".",然后最后两句歌词，心上的人儿，你不要悲伤，愿你的笑容永远那样。
"After losing her husband when she was 46, she has been singing this song while raising 4 kids until her death in the year before last.",后来我母亲在46岁的父亲去世了以后，她就带着四个孩子唱着这首歌，一直到前年她离开了这个世界。
I know this song will forever accompany her in the afterlife.,啊，这首歌永远地陪伴着她。
I think their relationship and sentiment toward each other resemble the love between Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai.,我觉得他们这种很崇高的那种深情那种真情，啊就是梁山伯祝英台式的爱情。
"Now, let me introduce my good friend, Miss Wang Weiqian, the chief mezzo-soprano of the Shanghai Opera House.",那么下面呢，我请出我的好朋友，那个上海歌剧院的首席女中音啊王维倩小姐，现在请王维倩。
Let's take a walk beside the Suzhou River in the beautiful melody composed by Chen Gexin!,让我们在陈歌辛先生所谱写的优美旋律中，大家和我一起到苏州河边去走一走。
"As Mr Chen has said, after a walk in silence with the singer Yao Li, Chen Gexin, the splendid composer, created this excellent song that has been passed down to today within a few minutes after he returned home.",歌曲的灵感呢就如陈老师所说，是歌仙陈歌辛先生和歌手姚莉女士在苏州河边默默无语地散步，回家后的几分钟，歌仙就写出了这首传世佳作。
It is also the catchiest oriental serenade I have ever heard.,迄今为止呢，也是我所听到的最为优美的一首东方小夜曲。
"We also call it ""Profound Serenade.""",我们称之为“深沉小夜曲”。
Thank you!,谢谢！
"Accompanied by Mr Chen, we will present these two romantic songs to all of you.",下面呢呃陈老师呢将为我伴奏，我们把这首他们父母两个人的情歌献给大家。
Hello everyone! I bring up a question for you: Which one do you think is safer in the sense of food safety?,上来就问各位一个问题，这样两盘菜，你感到哪一盘从食品安全的角度是更安全的？
Habitually we would jump to the right answer that we believe.,大家都有个习惯的回答。
"But I say hold on, let me finish and you would answer then.",我说别着急，等一等，等我把话讲完你们再回答不迟。
"I'm always feeling puzzled when asked by my friends: “What can we eat and what can’t we eat?"".",我呢经常给一个问题困惑，很多朋友问你“什么东西可以吃？什么东西不可以吃？”。
I couldn't answer that.,可把我难住了。
Why?,为什么呢？
"Many experts offered their answers to this question, most bullshit.",现在对这个问题，很多的专家有各种各样的讲法，不少是捣糨糊的。
"This is a question with infinite answers, which is, to our knowledge, no answer.",这个问题是一个无穷解的问题，大家知道无穷解就是没有解。
"So, what do we mean by no answer?",没有解是怎么回事？
"Let's say in this formula x+a=a+x, the value of the x is infinite.",就像一个方程，x+a=a+x这个方程是无穷解。
But the formula itself is false in the first place.,但是这个方程是错的，不成立的。
So whether it is a legitimate question is a question.,所以你那个问题成立不成立，本身就是个问题。
"Now let's see what we can do for this question with infinit answers, or no answer.",所以说我们现在来探索，这个有无穷解又无解的问题我们能做些什么。
"Since the Industrial Revolution in the UK, the humankind synthetized 30 million kinds of compounds.",那么我就讲从英国工业革命开始，人类合成了三千万种不同的化合物。
And nowadays 1 million or so new compounds are created annually in the laboratory by chemists.,到现在化学家在实验室里每年要创造出一百万种新的化合物。
"Many of which nowhere to be found in the natural world are invented by us human, creation of the God.",这些化合物很多，原来自然界里没创造的，就是上帝没有造的我们人造出来了。
"Some people say ""Being natural is always good, while being man-made is prone to problems"".",那么有些人都讲了都有一个观念就是“天然的总是好的，人造的都是有问题的”。
"I don't think it as a constant golden rule, rather the opposite always prevails.",并不永远如此，而且往往并不总是如此。
How is that?,这是为什么呢？
It's not the compound per se that matters when we are to judge a compound toxic or non-toxic.,就是一个化合物是有毒没毒，最要紧的不是这个化合物本身。
"Before the Renaissance in the 15-16th century in the West, there was a Swiss doctor and alchemy named Paracelsus in the Middle Ages, and he said once: Dosage determines the toxicity.",在十五到十六世纪就是西方的文艺复兴以前，还是中世纪，在瑞士呢有那么个医生，又是炼金术士的人，他叫Paracelsus，他说了一句话：剂量决定毒性。
"There are many things we human beings find indispensable, such as oxygen and water, without which we could not live.",有些东西是人日夜不可少的，比如氧气，比如水，没有这个就没有生命。
But some people would suffer oxygen poisoning due to excessive inhale of oxygen.,但是氧气过多有氧中毒。
"Similar cases are water poisoning, vitamins poisoning, especially fat-soluble vitamins.",水过多有水中毒，维生素吃多了维生素中毒，特别是脂溶性的维生素。
Now we often hear about selenium poisoning.,那么现在大家就有一种讲法，有一种元素叫硒元素，石字边一个西。
Selenium is a chemical element with anticancer effects.,就说能够抗癌啊什么。
But the intake of selenium has to be no more and no less.,硒元素是什么，多了不行少了也不行。
"According to my knowledge there are two famous places rich in selenium in China, one in the Enshi area of Hubei Province; the other in Ziyang Country in the Southern Shaanxi.",在我知道呢中国有两个地方，一个湖湖北西部的恩施地区，一个是陕西南部的陕南地区，特别叫紫阳县。
"In Ziyang, people produce high-selenium tea leaves and high-selenium corns.",这个地方出的茶叶是叫高硒茶叶，玉米叫高硒玉米。
I've been there and I saw many people were poisoned with selenium in both places.,但是这个地方真是中国两个硒中毒的地方，我去过，人还不少。
The story tells us that the proper dosage is delicate and essential to our health and safety.,所以道理呢就是说大家讲清楚，就是这个东西有个剂量，在一定的剂量，是有问题的，一定的剂量是安全的。
"No more, no less.",少于这个剂量也要出问题的。
"Therefore, we have the public health control system in place to manage and control the problem of dosage.",那么因为有剂量这个水平，就形成我们公共卫生控制的一个可行性，我们控制。
Now the second story.,好了，下面呢我再来讲一个故事。
It's about two common things.,这个故事有两个主角。
One is the roasted duck which could be found everywhere in China.,第一个主角烤鸭，讲清楚中国有好多种烤鸭。
But we narrow it down to the Beijing Roosted Duck for an example.,我们讲的是北京烤鸭。
"And the other is tortoiseshell just showed in the screen, or more specifically PAH.",第二个主角呢就刚才显出来那个乌龟壳，多环芳烃。
"So, what is the problem with the two things?",好了我们先把两个主角讲一下？
"Everyone is familiar with the Quanjude Roasted Duck, without knowing that there are two predecessors and one is called Menlu Rosted Duck (duck roasted in the oven).",大家都知道全聚德烤鸭，其实它是后来者，比它资格老的，一种叫焖炉烤鸭。
"It works this way: heat the oven first, put the duck in, and close the door. No flame seen.",那是怎么呢，就是说把炉子烧热了，然后把鸭子放进去，门关起来没有明火的，这叫焖炉烤鸭。
"There is a time-honored Menlu Roasted Duck restaurant in Beijing called Bianyifang, which have been open in the Ming Dynasty and struggled to exist till now.",在北京现在还有一家店，这家店从明朝开始到现在还在苟延残喘，叫便宜坊。
"The other is Gualu Rosted Duck (duck roasted over the fire), and we know from the name that it involves fire and firewood below, and it would be seen raw if a chef changes the place of the duck with a fork.",第二呢就是这个挂炉烤鸭，这个大家知道，明火底下有果木，然后那个师傅还要拿个叉子给它换地方的，这个资格要嫩得多了。
"The history of the roasted duck dates back to the Southern Song Dynasty when the Lin’an Rosted Duck was popular and Bo Yan, the general of the Yuan army carried off the famous chefs to the capital Dadu from Lin’an after the defeat of the Southern Song army, making the roasted duck a supreme delicacy in the Yuan palace.",烤鸭的历史呢就是有据可查，最早是从南宋开始，当时在临安烤鸭已经是种美味了，然后元朝打下临安以后，元朝那个军队的主帅叫伯颜，把临安的百工百匠给掳到大都去了，然后就把烤鸭搞到大都去，那就是元朝宫殿里已经成为一味美味。
"According to the literature, in 1330, a man wrote a book, or a collection of work notes of his work in the Yuan palace as a chief cook, and roasted ducks were found in the book.",最早文献记载是一三三零年，有一个人呢应该说相当于元朝宫殿里的行政主厨，他写了一本书，就是工作笔记，上面已经提到烤鸭了。
"Back in the Ming Dynasty in 1416, the Menlu Rosted Duck was very popular even in the Palace.",那么这个烤鸭呢就是说，在于明朝的时候宫殿里还是焖炉烤鸭，明朝的时候是1416年。
And Bianyifang was the very first Menlu Rosted Duck Restaurant in Beijing since then.,第一家烤鸭店就是便宜坊已经在北京开了。
"The restaurant is still operating in Xianyukou, outside of Qianmen, with its business on and off through the long history.",在前门外的鲜鱼口，一直开到现在，当然当中不是延续的。
Then when the Gualu Rosted Duck appeared?,焖炉烤鸭到挂炉烤鸭是什么时候？
According to literature it's believed that there was Gualu Rosted Duck in the Qing Palace during the reign of Emperor Qianlong.,现在材料认为是在乾隆朝，就是宫殿里有了。
When did Quanjude emerge?,但是全聚德是什么时候开的？
"About the 1860-1864 during the reign of Emperor Tongzhi, way after Bianyifang.",一要一八六几年一八六四年吧，已经到同治朝了，那晚多了。
But now the Gualu Rosted Duck gains the popularity.,但是现在呢就是说，普遍全面的都是这个挂炉得多。
I have tried both and I think the Gualu roasted duck tastes much better than the Menlu roasted duck.,呃我也吃过，我认为挂炉的比比焖炉的好吃。
"For the second common thing, PAH, what's that?",那么讲第二个主角，第二主角就多环芳烃，什么叫多环芳烃？
"From the tortoiseshell we could see six-benzene rings and five-benzene rings, and putting all this together we could get the PAH.",大家看一个个个乌龟壳，这个是六元苯环还有个五元的，然后这些壳呢要并在一起的，才叫多环芳烃。
"If benzene rings with bond doesn’t count, we have four-benzene rings, or benzopyrene.",如果当中有键的不算，这个是四个，苯并芘。
"There are 200-300 kinds of PAH, with benzopyrene as a typical case of strong toxicity.",多环芳烃现在知道有两百到三百种，那么这个苯并芘呢是一个代表，是里面最毒的一个。
"Speaking of benzopyrene, there is a special international cancer institute of the WHO in Lyon, France called IARC.",苯并芘呢它现在根据世界卫生组织下面有一个专门的机构叫国际癌症研究所IARC，在法国里昂。
This organization specializes in determining the carcinogenicity of all compounds.,它呢是国际上最权威的定各种化合物的致癌性这个威胁的。
Benzopyrene is a member of Group One by IARC.,苯并芘是定位第一类，group one。
What does this mean?,group one是什么意思呢？
Evidence-based carcinogenicity to human body.,有明确证据对人类有癌症威胁的。
"Of course, there are still Group 2A and 2B, which are under Group one.",那么还有group 2a、group 2b，那是下面的。
But we are talking about roasted ducks.,好了，我们下面就讲到烤鸭了。
"For the sake of research, we collected three kinds of roasted duck.",我们做烤鸭呢收集了三种烤鸭。
"The Menlu roasted duck, for one, was collected in Beijing.",第一种是焖炉的，到北京去取。
And the Gualu roasted duck was bought in one of the three branches of Quanjude in Shanghai.,第二种挂炉的，全聚德在上海有三个店当时。
And here is what it looks like.,一个店就是这种。
We put it down and bought it back.,取下来了，买买回来了。
"The third one, a Quanjude branch in Pudong, Shanghai, which uses electricity to roast ducks, not fire.",还有一个呢，全聚德里有一个店，当时开在浦东，它是不准用明火的，用电的。
"We tested all three roasted ducks in skin, meat and bones, and didn't find any benzopyrene in duck meat.",就三种烤鸭，然后我们就做了，做了以后呢，把烤鸭皮、肉、骨头全部拿来测，结果测下来以后发现，烤鸭的肉里面基本上没有苯并芘，肉里面所有的都没有。
"But high concentration of benzopyrene was found in the duck skin of Quanjude, above the national level.",然后最高的是全聚德的鸭皮上面，那个是多少呢，要超过我们国家标准。
The national level is 5 mcg for a 5-kilo roasted duck.,我们国家标准是每公斤烤鸭五个微克。
And we tested 8 mcg in those duck skin.,我们做出来大概相当于八个微克。
"Comparatively, we checked to know that such level exceeds the standards for all roasted poultry products in Europe.",远远超过了，而且这个是我们查了一下，超过所有欧洲国家那个烤禽产品上的那个东西。
"Unfortunately, the duck skin is the best of a roasted duck, so the problem must be in the roasted duck skin, right?",非常不幸的是吃烤鸭就吃烤鸭皮，问题就出在烤鸭皮，对不对？
And this is a problem.,这是一个问题。
"Meanwhile, it's terrible for people to eat ducks with higher level of benzopyrene than the national level and European levels.",第二个呢就是在想啦，这个问题严重了，超过国家标准又比欧洲标准还高。
So what should we do?,那么吃了怎么办？
We conducted a safety evaluation.,那么我们做了一个叫安全性评估。
"Generally we collected a few dozen of roasted duck of the same kind as samples, averaging about 2 kilo each.",一般说一个烤鸭我们收了大概几十个烤鸭样品，平均都在两公斤上下。
"Let's say one roasted duck for four people to eat, that would mean 0.68mcg of benzopyrene in the duck skin in one meal.",一般算一个烤鸭四个人吃，那么从这些鸭皮当中可以吃吃进去多少，吃进去是0.68个微克吃一餐。
"Still higher than the average level set by the European Food Safety Agency, which is between 0.2+ and -0.4.",那么又比欧洲标准高，欧洲食品安全署它算下来欧洲平均水平是0.2几，高位水平是0.4不到，又高了。
"Besides roasted duck, we tested vegetables as well.",但是另外一条我们又查了：蔬菜。
"Thanks to the statistics released by JECFA, an expert committee on food additives of WHO and FAO, we know the content of benzopyrene in vegetables in Northern China, which would not go public before China submitted it to the committee.",世界卫生组织跟国际粮农组织，就是WHO跟FAO底下有一个专家委员会，叫添加剂联合专家委员会，它呢两零零八公布了一个数据，中国北方地区蔬菜当中的苯并芘的含量，这个数据呢是我们中国国家国家报上去它才公布的。
"And we know the bottom line is 440g per person per day, meaning 2mg per day, much higher than the 0.68mcg in duck skin.",那么我们造一个低位水平就是，每人每天吃0.44公斤，0.44公斤就440克那个蔬菜，结果一算不对了，吃烤鸭吃下来才吃了0.68，然后那个吃吃一天吃下要两个毫克。
By now we know that vegetables aren't necessarily safe for sure.,那么刚才那个问题回答了，就说蔬菜安全并不永远如此，对不对，并不永远如此。
And this is one more problem.,这是一个问题。
So with data we have to rethink concepts and things.,那么现在还有一个问题啊就是，有很多观念要重新考虑，要用数据来考虑。
And what can we conclude by now?,那么讲到这里了就有一个问题了，我们可以得出什么结论？
"First, conventional or habitual ideas are not always right or safe.",第一，经常常规性的大家习惯性的观念并不永远如此。
Vegetables are not necessarily safer than roasted ducks.,蔬菜一定比烤鸭安全，不一定。
Is it a safe to eat roasted ducks?,吃烤鸭问题大吗？
"Well, people don't eat roasted ducks every day.",烤鸭不是天天吃的。
"The salariat would not have it every week, nor would successful rich men.",就是中国的工薪阶层每个礼拜吃也吃不消的，如果是那些很成功的人士，他也不想吃经常吃烤鸭的，所以烤鸭是难般吃吃。
"In addition, roasted ducks are served with vegetables, making it tasteful and healthy.",另外吃烤鸭的时候它里面还配东西，对不对，配那个蔬菜，这个是比较好的。
"This leads me to an interesting question, ""Can we leave the Earth by pulling our hair?""",那么又归到我们一个问题了，刚才说那个，唔能够拉着头发离开地球吗？
"So back to the question that I couldn't answer my friends, what did I respond?",就是刚才我还少讲一点，就是很多朋友问我这个问题我回答不出，那么怎么办呢？
"For close friends, I'd say ""Can you leave the Earth by pulling your hair? And if you can't, don't ask me such question as what can be eaten and what cannot.""",如果是熟的朋友，我说“你能拉着头发离开地球吗？不能，你就不要问我能吃什么不能吃什么。”
"Of course it's impossible for us to leave the Earth pulling our hair, then what should we do?",然后现在大家既然不能拉着头发离开地球，怎么办？
"Because even if you are a professional, you don't have a chemist around all the time.",你又不可能带一个化验师，即使专业人士也要带一个化验师。
So what to do?,那怎么办？
Here is my advice: You could eat anything but not excessive.,我给大家一个建议：什么东西都吃一点，什么东西都不要吃多。
You can favor one particular food but don't stick to one brand.,同样一个商品不同的牌号轮着吃，不要盯着一个牌子。
And this is called risk spreading.,这个叫什么呢？叫风险分散。
"In conclusion, I'd say it's still infinite if you add one to infinity, so what did I just say to you.",最后一个问题了，无穷大加一还是无穷大嘛，你们说你讲了什么。
"You would ask me for answer, for solution, and I'm asking myself, too.",你们要问我这个问题，我也在问我自己，我们该怎么办。
Thank you very much.,谢谢大家。

How much is the car worth?,啊价值是多少钱？
"These three questions correspond to the three basic subjects in image recognition, which are classification, detection and regression.",那么这三个问题呢分别对应了图像识别里面的三个这个基本的问题，啊也就是分类、呃检测和回归。
"Classification corresponds to the question ""what is…?""",那么分类呢对应的就是“是什么”的问题？
"In fact, when we as human beings ask what a picture is, we are dealing with an issue of picture classification.",啊当我们问一张图片它是什么的时候，那其实我们人类就在做一个图片分类的问题。
The second subject is detection.,那第二个问题呢就是检测。
Detection concerns wanting to know if there is something in a picture and where it is.,啊检测问题呢就是说我们想知道一张图片里面有没有一个东西，啊并且想知道它在哪里。
Such a question is called detection in the field of computer vision.,啊那么这样的一个问题，啊在我们计算机视觉里面叫做检测的问题。
"The third subject is regression, which means that we want to know if there is a numerical solution that can be derived from a picture.",啊第三个问题呢叫做回归，也就是说我们想知道一张图片里面啊是否有一个数值上的一个解答。
"For example, how much the car is worth, or how old a person is.",比如说它啊汽车值多少钱，啊一个人的岁数是多少。
This is called regression.,啊那么这样的一个一类问题呢叫做回归问题。
So what are the practical applications of these three subjects?,那么这三类问题有些什么实际应用呢？
The first is image classification.,啊首先呢就是图像分类。
"Now we can see a lot of pictures on the screen, including animals, plants, signs and so on.",那我们看到屏幕上呢展现了非常多的图片，啊里面有动物，啊有植物，啊留有一些标志牌之类的。
So how about we let the computer replace us human beings and tell users which categories the pictures belong to.,那么那么让计算机去代替我们人类去告诉啊它的使用者这些图片到底是什么样的类别。
This process is called general image classification.,那么这样的一个过程就叫做一个通用的图像分类的过程。
So what is image detection?,那么图像检测是什么样子呢？
Let's look at the screen now.,啊我们可以现在看屏幕。
"For the objects shown on the screen including ships, birds, airplanes, chairs, people, etc., the computer works out their positions and tells us where they are.",那么这些图片里面啊展示的包括轮船啊、鸟、飞机、椅子啊人这样的等等的一些物体，那么计算机把它定位出来，并且告诉我们它在哪里。
This process is called the detection of objects in an image.,那这样的一个过程呢，就叫做啊图像里面的这物体的检测。
Let's watch this short video.,我们这里面可以看啊一小段视频。
This video is generated with a camera moving at high speed in a very crowded traffic area.,啊那么这视频里面呢，展示了啊一个呃就是说摄像头高速地在啊这一个非常拥挤的一个交通区域上面移动，让它们拍摄到的这样的画面。
The computer can detect any vehicles that appear in the video in real time.,那么计算机呢，是可以实时地检测到这个视频里面啊所出现的车辆。
This method is a core component of Baidu's driverless car technology as well as being an application of image detection.,啊那么这样的一个这样的一个方法啊也是啊我们百度啊无人车的一个技术上的一个基数，也是图像检测的一个应用。
"Next, let's look at image segmentation.",啊那么下一个呢，想要介绍的是图像分割。
Image segmentation concerns the situation where we input an image into a computer and we want to know which semantic category each pixel in the image belongs to.,啊图像分割呢就是说，当计算机当我们给计算机输入一张图片的时候，我们想知道啊这个图片里面的每一个像素点啊它是属于哪一个语义类别。
"For example, does it belong to the semantic category of motorcycle, or person, or car?",啊比如说它是属于一个摩托车的一个语义类别的这样的一个区域，还是属于一个人，还是属于一个汽车？
We want the computer to distinguish such points from the entire picture.,啊那么我们希望计算机把这样的一些点啊从整个图片里面分辨出来。
This process is called image segmentation.,这样的一个过程呢叫做图像分割。
Here is another video.,啊我这里面呢，再是再次展示了一个视频。
The video shows one of our colleagues sitting in our office cubicle.,啊视频里面呢是我们的一位同学坐在这个啊我们的工位上面。
"As the camera (in this case, a phone) moves, we can see that our technology can help differentiate him from the background in real time.",那么随着这个啊相机啊也就是说手机的移动，我们可以看到啊我们的方法可以实时地把他从这个背景里面给分割出来。
Next up let's consider a basic application of image recognition called picture question answering.,下一个图像识别的一个基础的应用呢，我们这里面叫做图片问答。
"This refers to the situation where we input an image, and also want to ask some questions about the image.",啊意思就是说当我们输入一张图片的时候呢，我们同时呢啊希望对这个图片进行一些提问。
"For example, we might ask: ""What color is the vehicle in this picture?""",比如说我们的提问是：“啊这个图片里面的汽车是什么颜色的？”
"We want the computer to answer: ""It is yellow.""",啊那么我们希望计算机回答说：“它是黄色的。”
"So for this kind of process, the computer must not only recognize that there is a car in the picture, but also know that the car is yellow; it has to know what 'yellow' corresponds to in the picture.","那么在这样的一个过程中呢,计算机不止要能识别到这个图片里面是有一个汽车的，还要知道这个汽车是黄色的；不仅要知道啊黄色对应着一个什么样的一种呃图片上的样子。"
This whole process is called picture question answering.,那么整个的这样的一个过程呢啊叫做图片问答。
Here is another example.,啊那么我们下面呢啊也展示了一个例子。
In this example there is a little bear in the picture.,啊这个例子里面呢就是说，呃里面有一个小熊。
This is Baidu's intelligent question answering system.,那么这样一个系统呢就是一个百度的智能问答的系统。
There is a pizza.,“有一个披萨”。
So now we have introduced the basics of image recognition.,啊，那我们前面呢大概呢就介绍了图像识别的啊基础知识。
"Next, let's take a look at how these seemingly cool applications are implemented.",那我们这里面呢大概看一下这些看起来很酷炫的应用，它们是怎么来实现的。
The process of computer image recognition goes like this: first we extract the underlying features of the input image.,啊那么呢啊大概呢计算机的一个进行图像识别的过程是这样子的：就是说我们首先呢对一个输入的图像呃进行一个底层的特征的呃一个提取。
"Historically, the underlying feature maps were actually hand-designed, and might include such elements as color histograms, gradient histograms, and summarized information about edges and corners in images.",啊那么早期的这种底层特征呢其实啊是一些人手工设计的特征，啊可能包括一些颜色的直方图，啊一些梯度的直方图，包括一些图像的边缘啊和这种角这样的一些信息上的概括。
Next we identify these features with a classifier to achieve image recognition.,然后呢我们把这种特征去进行一个啊分类器的识别，那么这样的一个方法去进行图像的识别。
"With the development of technology, we will find that image classification based directly on underlying features is not very effective.",啊那么随着技术的发展呢，呃大家会发现就是说直接把这种图像的底层特征去用来分类，啊效果是并不好的。
Why?,啊为什么呢？
"For example, we want to recognize a person, but the person's movements and postures change.",比如说啊我们想去识别一个人，啊但是人的动作和他的这个姿态是会有变化的。
"As the person moves, the underlying features we extract no longer give us a stable representation.",那么随着他姿态的变化，我们提取到的这些底层的特征就不再是一个稳定的表示了。
"So, scientists have invented another method, which performs some middle-level representations upon the underlying features.",啊所以呢，啊科学家们呢发明了另外一种方法，啊就是说在这个底层的特征上面呢进行一些中层的表示。
"This comprises several methods including the spring model, tape model, and pyramid model.",啊提出了包括像啊弹簧模型，啊像这个磁带模型，还有像金字塔模型这样的一类的方法。
"Naturally, following this train of thought, we can also perform high-level representations.",啊那一个很自然的这样的一个，呃我们随着这个思路想下去，那我们是不是也可以有一个高层的表示。
"This, then, is how deep learning was established.",啊于是呢，这个深度学习就这样被建立起来了。
"One of the ideas of deep learning is that we don't design any features ourselves, but let the computer carry out end-to-end learning.",那么深度学习的一个思路呢，就是说我们人类自己不去设计任何的特征，而是让计算机呢啊去进行一个端到端的学习。
"All the features and representations from beginning to end, including the process of subsequent classification, are all learned by the computer itself, instead of being designed by humans.",啊从头到尾所有的特征、所有的表示，包括后面的分类过程，啊那么都是呃一个计算机它自己学习得到的，而不是人设计出来的。
The process of deep learning as applied to pictures is called convolutional neural networks.,那么我们把深度学习的过程啊用在图片上，那么也就是卷积神经网络。
The input to the convolutional neural network is a picture.,嗯一个卷积神经网络的输入呢是一个图片。
"The convolutional neural network consists of a number of convolutional layers, each of which processes the input image and then obtains a structure similar to the image, which is called an output layer.",啊那么嗯卷积神经网络包括很多卷积层，啊每一层呢会把输入的图片去啊进行处理，然后得到一个类似于图片的一个结构，我们这里面叫做一个输出层。
The output layer of the previous convolution is input to the input layer of the next convolution.,那么上一层卷积的输出层输入到下一层卷积的输入里面去。
"With this layer-to-layer processing, we can extract more and more advanced feature representations from the image.",啊随着一层一层卷积这样的处理，那我们就可以从图片中提取到啊越来越高级的特征表示。
"Finally, feeding this feature representation into the classifier, we obtain the result we want for the input image, which may be a classification result, or a question answering result.",啊最后呢我们把这个特征表示去放在分类器里面去，然后我们就可以对啊这个输入的图片啊得到一个我们想要的东西，啊可能是一个分类的结果，啊可能是一个问答的结果。
Here we can see that one difference between deep learning and the traditional method is that the former is extremely reliant on data support.,嗯那这里面呢呃我们可以看到，这个深度学习啊与传统的方法一个很不同的地方在于呢，啊它是极其需要这个数据来支持的。
"From the earliest stages of Caltech 101, it actually contained one hundred and one categories, thousands of pictures.",那么从早期的这个呃Caltech 101，啊这样呢它其实包含了一百零一个类别，啊包含了几千张图片。
"Later, it gradually developed into the SCENE15 data set, then to Caltech256, then later to SUN and then finally to ImageNet.",然后后来呢渐渐发展到后面的这个SCENE15这个数据集，啊发展到这个Caltech256，啊发展到后来的这个SUN，到最后的这个ImageNet。
"Gradually, the volume of data increased from a few thousand items to several million, and data categories from around 100 to more than a thousand.",啊渐渐的呢我们这个数据的量啊从几千张呃变成了几百万张，那么这个数据的类别呢从啊一百类左右呢变成了现在的啊一千多类。
Baidu has a huge database with hundreds of millions of images and tens of millions of categories.,那么百度呢啊是有一个非常非常大的一个数据库，啊那么这里面有包含着几亿的图片啊上千万的这样的一个类别。
"This vast amount of data supports the Baidu Brain, resulting in computing performance that surpasses that of any other similar technology.",那么这样庞大的数据呢才呃支持了百度大脑啊得到了超出啊任何其他同类技术的这样的一个计算性能。
"In addition to our data, we also have an extremely strong network structure.",啊那么除此之外呢，就是说除了数据之外呢，啊我们也有啊非常非常强的这样的一个网络结构。
"In 1998, the deep learning method of the time was called LeNet, which was a very superficial convolutional neural network used to recognize handwritten fonts.",那么在九八年的时候呢，呃当时的深度学习的方法啊叫做一个呃Le呃LeNet呃，那么它是一个非常浅层的一个卷积神经网络，啊当时是用来做这个手写字体的识别。
"2012 saw the invention of a structure called AlexNet, which was able to successfully process millions of images in thousands of categories and achieved the best image classification results in the world at the time.",那么在2012年的时候呢，呃有人发明了这个叫做AlexNet这样的一个结构，那么它已经可以啊成功地处理那么上千类别上百万张的图片，啊得到了当时世界上最好的图像分类的结果。
"As this technology has continued to develop, we have reached the point where we can now implement a very deep convolutional neural network consisting of five hundred, or even a thousand layers, delivering image classification results that far surpass the networks of 2012.","啊那么随着这个技术的发展呢,那么现在呢，呃我们已经可以去实现一个啊五百层乃至一千层这样的一个非常深的一个卷积神经网络，啊那么得到的这个图像分类的结果是呃远远远超过一二年的这个同类的一个网络。"
"Next, let's consider the applications of deep learning in actual products from Baidu IDL.",那么我下面呢介绍一下子就是说呃百度IDL这边啊是有哪些把深度学习用在啊实际产品中的这个应用。
"First, we can see that Baidu is the first company in the world to invent a semantic-based image retrieval and word-guessing system.",呃首先呢我们可以看到，就是说呃呃百度呢是世界上面啊首个发明了基于语义的图像的这个呃检索和猜词系统。
"In the so-called retrieval and guessing system, when the user enters an image instead of text, the system can not only return a similar picture that is very close to the semantics of the original picture, but also tell the user what category the picture belongs to.",啊所谓检索和猜词系统呢，就是说呃当用户输入一张图片而不是一个文字的时候，那么我们的这个系统是可以啊不但可以返回跟这个图片语义上非常接近的类似的图片，我们还可以告诉用户那么这张图片它是一个什么样的类别。
"For example, we can tell the user that the input image is a plant, and further a peony flower.",比如说我们可以告诉用户，啊这张输入的图片是一个植物，啊然后它是一个牡丹花，啊类似于这样的功能。
"In addition, IDL boasts the best pornography recognition system in the world.",嗯另外呢，就是说IDL拥有啊现在世界上最好的呃就是色情识别系统。
"We know that there are a lot of this type of pictures on the web, some of which have been uploaded by users and may be prohibited or illegal.",啊然后我们知道就是现在网络上面有非常非常多的啊这样的图片，那其中一部分用户上传的图片啊可能是这个违禁违规的。
"Our system can intelligently recognize with very high speed and high accuracy, whether a picture is normal or is pornographic or sexy, and then exclude inappropriate images from the Internet.",啊那么我们的系统是可以啊以非常快的速度、非常准确的这个呃性能，那么呃智能地识别出来它是一个啊正常的图片还是一个色情或者是一个性感的图片，那么呢就是把呃不该出现的图片啊排除在互联网之外。
"In addition, we have comprehensively applied our image technology to the Phoenix Nest system.",呃另外呢就是说嗯我们这里面把啊图像的技术啊综合地应用在呃我们的这个凤巢这样的一个系统里面去。
"In other words, we can intelligently tap the preference of an Internet user.",啊也就是说呢我们可以智能地挖掘那么一个呃互联网的一个用户。
"When a user searches for something, what kind of picture do they want?",当他在搜索的时候，啊他是想看到一个什么样的图片？
"We can then show the user a relevant picture, which may make them more inclined to click on it, and subsequently purchase the products linked to the picture.",啊那么我们把这样的图片展示给他，啊他可能会呃更倾向于点击这样的图片，啊并且购买啊图片链接后面的这样的一个产品。
"We have already covered a lot of basic image knowledge, as well as deep learning in changing image technology and the applications of deep learning technology in Baidu products.",呃那我们前面呢其实已经讲了呃非常多的图像的基础知识，啊乃至深度学习，啊对图像技术的这样的一个改变和呃我们的深度学习技术啊在百度的应用。
"But in fact, deep learning technology still has a lot of deficiencies.",呃但是呢其实深度学习技术还是有很多的不足之处。
"For example, in this picture on the screen, when we human beings see it, we may ask ourselves 'what is it?'",啊比如说现在屏幕上面的这张图片，啊我们一人类看到这张图片可能会会在想啊这是一个什么东西呢？
Are there some people standing there?,是啊是一些一些人站在这里吗？
Or what is their positional relationship?,啊还是说呃他们有一些位置上的关系啊？
And a computer can only go this far.,计算机可能也只能做到这样子。
"So, what exactly is going on in the picture?",嗯那么他们到底是什么？
"In fact, once we've observed the picture clearly, we can see that it shows the last US President Barack Obama joking with his staff.",啊实际上呢当我们把这个图片放清晰之后，我们可以看到，啊啊它这里面想表达的是当时的这个美国的上一任总统奥巴马啊在跟啊一个他的一个属下在开玩笑。
So what the picture really intends to convey is a sense of humor.,啊所以这张图片真实想表达的意思是一个幽默感的一个事情。
"Although our current computer system can detect people and recognize what this scene is, it cannot understand the deeper meaning that the picture really intends to convey.",那我们现在的计算机系统呢虽然说它可以检测出人，啊可以识别出这个场景里面是什么，但是它还无法啊理解这种图片中真实想表达的这种深层次的语义。
This is the direction towards which we will continue to work hard in the future.,啊这也是我们以后将为之努力的方向。
Thank you everybody!,啊谢谢大家！
"Good afternoon, everyone!",诶大家下午好！
I'm very glad to have this opportunity to introduce Baidu's current voice technology to you.,非常高兴有这个机会跟大家聊一聊额百度目前的额语音技术。
"In fact, the voice technology is a highly focused technology.",其实语音技术是一个非常专注的技术，
We focus on two aspects only.,我们只专注于两个方面。
The first aspect is to recognize the sounds of all things. ,第一个方面是我们讲的要识别声音。
"The second aspect is to synthesize sounds, and our objective is to synthesize the sounds of all things if possible. ",可以说是识别万物的声音，另外一方面就是合成声音。
"However, 99% of our work is to recognize and synthesize human voices.",有可能的话我们的梦想当然是合成万物的声音，但实际上现在我们百分之九十九的工作都在识别人类的声音和合成人类的声音。
"So, I'd like to talk about some achievements recently made by Baidu in the voice technology.",所以给大家介绍一下百度最近在这个语音额技术方面的一些进展。
I think that Baidu attaches the greatest importance to the voice technology among all the Internet companies.,额百度应该是额所有的互联网公司里面我认为最重视语音技术的公司。
"We have been constantly and resolutely investing in the voice technology for many years, and we apply every breakthrough technology to our products promptly.",我们从额非常早的时间就持续不断地、非常坚决地对语音技术进行投入，而且只要我们的技术有了突破，就马上把它放到各个产品上。
"So, if you use Baidu's products, you can find that almost all of them provide excellent voice-recognition experience.",所以额如果大家使用百度的一些产品的话，你会发现几乎每个产品额都有很好的语音体验的功能。
"Here are some of these products, and I highly recommend our Baidu App.",额这里面额列了这这样一些产品吧，我这边强力推荐的就是我们的手百。
The voice search experience on Baidu App is really amazing. ,我们手百上的这个语音搜索体验啊真的是非常的好。
"When using it, you can just press the microphone button and speak instead of typing with your fingers.",额你们要是有机会额一定不要用这个手这个手指再打打字了，直接按着上面那个麦克。
"Now, our voice recognition is highly accurate.",然后说说就是说任何的话，我们现在识别应该是非常的准。
"We have been constantly investing in this technology, and made new breakthroughs in the voice technology almost every year.",额正因为我们在这技术上一直坚持不断地投入，实际上额我们基本上是以每年为单位，在语音技术上都有这样的突破。
"As you can see, in 2012, we became the first one to apply the deep learning technology and the DNN technology to products among the Internet companies in China.",大家看从这个2012年我们是额国内的互联网公司里面第一家把深度学习技术把这DNN的技术在工程应用上应用到我们的产品上的这样的一个团队。
We all know that the deep learning technology was first developed in 2010 and 2011.,大家都知道深度学习起来的时候基本上是在额10年、11年这个样子。
But breakthroughs lied mainly in academic conferences and public test sets.,但那个时候大部分还都是在这个额学术会议上，还有在这个额公开的测试集上取得的一些突破。
"In 2012, we fully migrated the deep learning technology to our product line.",但是我们在2012年就已经把这个深度学习技术完整地搬到了我们这个线上。
We completely engineered it. ,额我们把它完整的工程化。
"In fact, if you have ever involved in the project, you should know that the accuracy improvement of a public or private test set is greatly different from that of a high-traffic product line.",就是是实际上大家做这个工程的应该都知道，就是你在公开的测试集上或者你私有的测试集上取得的这个进这个这个准确度的提升和你在实际线上能够应付非常高的海海量的这个流量上面，这个准确度的提升这个是非常不一样的。
"For example, if you try the voice search function on Baidu App now, you can find that the result is displayed quickly on the screen.",额举个例子，就是我们现在的手百的语音搜索，如果你去体验的话额你会发现它的上屏的速度非常的快。
"That is, the characters are displayed on the screen as soon as your voice comes out.",就是说只要你的声音一出来我们马上就会有字上屏。
"We have done a large amount of work to achieve such top-level user experience by shortening the system response time to 100 milliseconds, 50 milliseconds and even 20 milliseconds.",这里面我们做了非常非常多的工作，基本上就是100毫秒、50毫秒、20毫秒这么一点一点地抠，才能有这样极致的用户的体验，所以这个我们做了非常多的工作。
We have also made improvements on the models every year.,然后呢，上面基本上每一年吧都有这个额模型上面的一些提升。
I will not talk about them one by one.,我们不一一的说了。
"Later, I will talk about our recent advances in the acoustic models.",额一会儿的话给大家介绍一下我们最近的在我们声学模型上的一些额进步。
Our current main breakthroughs are almost concentrated on the so-called end-to-end voice recognition model.,额，我们现在的比较好的突破，基本上还都是集中在所谓的端到端的这个额语音识别的这个模型上。
"Unlike the end-to-end model, the conventional voice recognition model includes the acoustic model and the language model.",和端到端额不太一样的是，以前传统的这个语音识别它基本上是分得比较细，先是这个声学模型，然后语言模型。
The speeches are converted into texts via a decoder after being processed by AM and LM in sequence.,然后额两边的话再同进入一个解码器，最后呢出这个文字。
"However, we have experimented with the end-to-end model for a long time.",但是端到端的呃这个模型的实验我们也做了很久。
"At the beginning, our idea was to catch the sound waves and convert them directly into Chinese characters by our deep learning model. ",在最一开始的时候，额我们的这个想法是把声波进来，然后呢额通过我们的深度学习的模型我们希望直接出的就是汉字。
"This was a complete end-to-end model, but we met challenges on it.",这样的话是一个比较完整的端到端的模型，但这个在这个模型上我们也碰到了一些困难。
"Although we achieved a higher accuracy rate on some test sets compared to the previous models, we encountered two challenges.",虽然我们在一些很好的这个测试集上取得了比以前的额这个模型很好的这个准确率的提升，但是我们碰到两个困难。
One is to recognize speeches mixed with English and Chinese.,一个是中英文识别。
"Nowadays when we speak, many of us are used to speaking Chinese with some English words, right?",因为咱们现在大部分人说说话的话，很多时候都会夹杂着这个英文是吧？
"For example, many expressions like ""When will this ‘iPhone’ be available on the market?"", ""Where does ‘Angelababy’ shoot recently?"" and “Songs of ‘TFboys’” have combined both Chinese and English words, which brings new challenges to the voice recognition technology.",比如ii这个iPhone什么时候上啊？这个Angelababy最近在哪儿演戏呀？然后TFboys的歌啊什么的，很多中英文合在一起，这样的话会对这个技术带来挑战。
The other one is to recognize new words.,另外一个就是生生词。
"For the deep learning model, once the output terminal is fixed, it cannot be changed or updated dynamically.",因为额这个深度学习的模型它的一个输出的头如果你一旦把它固固这个固定了，它就已经是固定的，它不能动态地去变化。
"We used four to five thousand Chinese characters, but still failed to include the newly created Chinese characters.",所以我们当时额用了四五千个汉字，但是呢没有办法去囊括这个新生成的这样的汉字。
So we made many technological explorations to solve this problem.,所以后面我们又进行了一系列的这个技术的探索吧。
"So far, we have made a new breakthrough in the end-to-end technology.",到了今天我们端到端的技术又取得了一个新的突破。
I briefly presented it at Baidu World Conference. ,这个突破我在额我们百度世界大会上也稍微地介绍了一下。
We changed the modeling unit from previous Chinese character unit to the current high-frequency phoneme unit.,就是我们现在把我们建模单元从以前的这个汉字的单元又变成了这个我们叫高频音素的单元。
"As a result, our modeling ability was greatly improved. ",这样的话我们的建模能力比以前又有了很大的提提升。
"We also overcame another problem. That is, if the modeling unit is small, it may easily cause over-fitting during training.","而且我们还克服了,这个当你建模单元比较小的时候这个训练的时候容易过拟合的问题。"
"By using the phoneme modeling method, we have made great breakthroughs in voice recognition for Chinese or English speeches, natural utterances and randomly long speeches.",所以我们现在用纯音素的建模的方式，我们在额中英文上，我们在这个自然语流的说话，就是你大大时间就是这个很长时间随意地说说话这个识别上都取得了一些比较好的突破。
"We will continuously optimize this end-to-end model, and we believe that it is a favorable trend of developing the voice recognition technology in the future.",所以这个端到端的模型我们后续会持续地把它优化下去，我们认为这一定是就是语音识别在后面一段时间比较好的一个技术方向。
"So far, many competitors claim that their voice recognition rate is 97% or 98%. ",所以，额做到现在的话，大家也会看到就是很多竞品也在说我们的识别率是97%，我们的识别率是98%。
"In fact, this is for the near-field voice.",实际上额这个大的环境下都是针对所谓的近场语音。
The so-called near-field voice is just like how I speak right now. ,所谓的近场语音就是我现在的说话的这个模式。
"The distance between the sound source and the receiver is less than one meter, and my voice is clear.",就是这个声源额离这个收音的这个设备在小于一米的范围之内，而且呢说话是比较清晰的。
This is called the near-field voice.,我们管这个叫近场的语音。
The near-field voice technology has been optimized after constant technological breakthroughs in recent years.,在近场的语音上，额经过这几年技术上不断地突破，已经做得非常的完完整和完善。
Here are some applications of the near-field speech recognition.,这里面给大家列了一些近场语音上面额的一些应用。
I won't elaborate.,额这边就不一一个一个的细的跟大家说了。
"You can try the voice recognition on our Baidu App, Baidu Map, and TalkType.",就是额大家也可以试试我们额这个通过不论是手手百也好，地图也好，还是我们语音的输入法也好，下面的语音应用。
"When you whisper, your voice will be accurately recognized even if your vocal cords do not vibrate. ",就是你在小声轻声说话的时候，就是你的这个声音，你的这个声带没有震动的时候你去跟它喷那个字，它也会非常好地给你识别出来。
This model is highly robust for the near-field voice.,就是这个模型的鲁棒性已经非常好，对于近场来讲。
"Therefore, we think the near-field speech recognition is sophisticated and advanced with high accuracy, although there are many different opinions on its accuracy and recognition rate.",所以我们认为额虽然外面有很多的PR这个准确率、识别率是什是什么样的，但对于近场语音技术来讲，已经基本上是一个比较成熟的状态，就是它的技术高度已经非常的高了，它的准确率也已经非常的准了。
The sole thing we need to do is to make horizontal applications based on the accurate near-field voice recognition.,额唯一我们需要做的就是在近场语音这个非常准的技技术的基础上做很多的横向的应用。
"Horizontal applications are our most important objective. They involve recognition of dialects, Chinese, English and other minority languages worldwide, as well as conferences and speeches.","譬如说方言的识别,中英文的识别,额国际化各种各种特殊语种的识别,然后会议的识别,什么说话人的识别，各种各样横向的应用才是最重要的。"
"At this point, creativity and intelligence of our developers are strongly appreciated.",所以这个时候，实际上额真的是非常需要我们的开发者们去发挥你们的聪明才智。
"So far, the near-field voice technology is quite satisfactory, and we expect that it can be widely applied in different Apps.",因为对于近场的语音技术来讲，我们觉得做到目前，额我们已经属于比较满意的状态，唯一想看到的就是它在应用上去大规模地去推广。
I want to talk a bit more about this. ,这一块儿再多说一点。
"So far, what degree has our near-field voice technology reached?",就是近场语音到了一个什么样的程程度呢？
"For example, we randomly pick some voice search queries from Baidu App.",就是额我们把手百上的语音搜索的这个query把它额拿下来一个批次。
"The users are of different age groups and from different regions, so they have different accents.",因为它是有不同的年龄段和不同的这个地域带有不同的口口这个口音。
We  randomly pick 50 queries and have some people and our online models listen to it.,又随机地找出50个这样的query，然后去让人来听，还有让这个我们的这个线上的模型去听。
"If you randomly ask a person to compete with our online model, this person probably will fail.",如果你随机地抽一个人和我们线上模型比的话，你基本上是额不会被额就我们的模型基本上会PK掉你。
Our model would only fail if more than 20 people cooperated to challenge it. ,唯一没有PK掉的时候就是大20多个人一起商量。说这个哎，这个听这个话到底是什么意思。
"Under this circumstance, there is a chance that the model would fail.",这个这个时候有的时候能够PK掉线上的模型。
"The accuracy rate is high for near-field voice recognition, and it shows the current status of the technology.",就是近场的语音，额这个识别现在就这么准，这个是它现在的技术现技术的现状。
Now let's take a look at some of our queries online.,现在给大家稍微额看一下我们现在线线上的一些query。
Let's listen.,大家也就听听一听一随便听一下。
"""Boonie Bears"".",熊出没。
The online query comes from the search engine.,就是就是因为线上的话我们的query都是搜索的嘛。
"So, it is a direct statement, and does not contain any context. ",就大家都是那么直接说说一句话，没有上文也没有下文。
A single word or phrase suddenly comes out.,就突然间就这么一句话。
"Actually, this is a quite difficult scenario for context-based voice recognition.",实际上这是一个额相对于上下文关联的来讲是一个比较难的语音识别的问题。
"""Boonie Bears"".",熊出没。
I wonder what you hear from this.,也不知道大家听到是什么意思。
"""Boonie Bears"".",熊出没。
Look.,看。
This is a little kid searching for the cartoon.,它是小孩子找那个动画动画片儿。
Let's listen to another one.,再听一个。
"""Boonie Bears"".",熊出没。
Now it sounds like what it is.,你现在听就肯定听的比较有像的。
"However, if I play it to you suddenly, you may fail to understand it.",但是如果猛的一句拿给你听，你还真不一定能听懂它是什么意思。
"""How to make Braised Dongpo Pork?""",东坡肉怎么做？
I have heard that one of our audience already recognized it.,你看我我听到有的那个我们我们的那个听众里面把它听准了。
"""How to make Braised Dongpo Pork?""",东坡肉怎么做？
"""How to make Braised Dongpo Pork?""",东坡肉怎么做？
Such queries fall into many different categories.,这个它的query是额分成各种各样不同的。
"For example, we find that most children are searching for their expected cartoons.",比如说我们看到孩子的，大部分都是搜他想要的就是动画片的资源。
"""A lot of Ultramen.""",好多奥特曼。
It's hard for ordinary people to recognize what a kid shouts suddenly.,这小孩儿喊一嗓子其实对于我们普通人来讲还是挺难的。
"""A lot of Ultramen.""",好多奥特曼。
"""A lot of Ultramen.""",好多奥特曼。
I assume that we may still fail to recognize what it is even if we replay it several times.,我估计再放几遍可能也就也不太好听。
So this voice recognition technology is highly robust for the near-field voice.,所以这个语音技术来讲就是它的鲁棒性已经非常强，对于现对于这种近场的语音来。
"""A lot of Ultramen.""",好多奥特曼。
We can understand it when listening to it at this time.,这回听可以啦。
So we are highly willing to get such a voice technology available on ai.baidu.com.,所以这里面就是在语音这个技术存在这样的一个状态的话，我们是非常愿意把它去开放的，就是这里面我们语音技术也在这个ai.baidu.com上也会进一步的去开放。
"There are mainly three aspects: recognition, synthesis, and wake-up.",大概就是三个方面：一个是识别，一个是合成，一个是唤醒。
"Later, I will focus on our wake-up technology, because we have the faith that our voice technology could help people ""wake up everything"", and enable all devices to use our wake-up words.",一会儿的话会跟大家再着重地介绍一下我们的唤醒技术，因为额我们有一个理念就叫做我们希望我们的语音技术能够帮助大家叫“唤醒万物”，就是让所有的设备都能够额使用我们的唤醒词。
"Our Baidu is called ""Xiaodu"".",我们百度叫“小度小度”。
"We can simply wake it, and then talk to it.",额说一声嗯，然后呢就能够通过语音的方式跟它进行去对话。
We knew that this technology was important when we get involved with it.,这个这个技术额就是我们在做的时候知道它重要。
"Later, we further discovered that among the three aspects including recognition, synthesis and wake-up, the most difficult technology is wake-up, and we hold the same view even inside Baidu.",但是做到现在我们才知道这个是，额我们现在这三这三代里面，识别、合成和唤醒，最难的技术是唤醒，就是哪怕在百度的话我们也这样认这个认为。
"The best voice wake-up is extremely hard to achieve, but it will be a very good experience for users.",你把唤醒做到极致是一个非常难的任务，而且如果把它做到极致是一个非常好的体验。
There are a lot of collaboration cases. ,这里面很多合作案例啊。
I will not talk about all of them.,就不跟一一跟大家说了。
Our platform has been established for quite a long time. ,我们额这个平台做的比较早，
It currently bears heavy traffic. ,目前的话上面流量也比较大。
"Therefore, we have accumulated many partners and enjoyed good cooperation with them.",所以积累了一系列的各种各样的这个合作的这个伙伴，跟我们现在都合作的那个还是蛮不错的。
We mentioned that we are going to open some technologies at Baidu Create this year.,所以这是我们额就是今年开发者大会上，我们说我们要开放的一些技术。
We will fully open our technologies. ,额我们的开放还是很全面的。
"That is, we will not simply provide an online interface and ask you to use it directly.",就是我们并不是说简简单单的一个线上给你一个接口，然后你直接去调用就可以了。
"Instead, we will fully open these technologies from terminals to the cloud.",而是说我们是从端到云额全面的开放。
You can use our SDK on your terminals. ,额从端上你们可以用我们的这个SDK。
"We will enable your terminals to have excellent voice recognition and barge-in capability to cut off the voices properly, and send them to our cloud for more accurate recognition.",额我们会赋予你的这个端上面特别好的这个语音的识音的能力和这个语音的切断的能力，能够把这个语音切得特别准，然后发到我们云端的话，识别的话就可以更一步得准。
We will also get other aforesaid voice technologies available for you.,然后在语音上我们之前说到的一系列的这个能力，都会向大家去开放。
"In addition, we will open our new voice contents, including some regional dialects, Chinese and English speech.",然后后面这个是我们额新开放，这个我们的包括我们的一些方言，然后中英文。
"Now, let's talk about our challenges and solutions for the voice technologies.",那么后面我们可以再讲一下我们语音技术目前碰到的挑战和我们要做的一些事情。
This is our newly launched voice recognition function for the call center.,这个是额刚刚上线的这个呼叫中心的语音识别。
"We are also engaged in many projects for commercialization, and so we have optimized our model for the call center. ",因为我们也在内部也在做很多的商业商业化，所以我们针对呼叫中心专门对我们的模型做了优化。
"If you have related applications, you can use this technology.",所以大家如果有专门针对这方面的额你们应用的话可以用到这方这方面的技术。
"Okay, let's watch a video clip, it's a demonstration of a long speech. ",好，下面看一个我们这个视频吧，我们长语音的一个演示。
Please play it for us.,工作人员给播放一下。
Welcome to the AI Developer Conference. ,欢迎大家来到AI开发者大会。
I'm very glad to demonstrate Baidu's voice technology.,很高兴为大家做百度语音技术的演示。
"Our voice technology mainly consists of voice recognition, voice wake-up, and voice synthesis, etc.",我们的语音技术主要包括：语音识别、语音唤醒、语音合成等技术。
Long speech recognition is also outstanding. ,长语音识别的能力也比较突出。
"Like my speech now, it can be recognized in real time, and it works with whispering too.",比如我现在说的话，就可以被同步识别，另外小声说话也能够被识别。
Now I am in a meeting.,我现在正在开会。
I will call you later.,开完会后给你电话。
The sound of singing can also be recognized.,甚至连歌声都可以被识别。
Let's listen to a part of the song The Road to Ordinary.,下面给大家唱一段《平凡之路》。
"I’ve crossed mountains and oceans, and wandered through crowds. ",我曾经跨过山和大海，也穿过人山人海。
Everything I once had faded away in the blink of an eye. ,我曾经拥有着的一切，转眼都飘散如烟。
"I was once frustrated and disappointed, lost all direction, until I saw that the only answer lies in the road to ordinary.",我曾经失落，失望，失掉所有方向，直到看见平凡才是唯一的答案。
"This handsome guy is our engineer, specializing in neural network language models.",这个这个帅哥是我们专门做神经网络语言模型的工程师。
"You can take out your mobile phone, and use our Baidu App and Baidu's voice input method to have a try. ",所以大家可以试，因为你们手头就有手机，就能用那个手百，然后还有这个语音输入，百度的语音输入法，你们都可以试。
These two approaches are exactly the same.,额这两个完全都是一样。
"At the last Baidu World Congress, we also introduced the technology that displays texts converted from real-time speech.",而且我们在最近的这个百度世界大会上，也上了我们的实时的语音上屏。
"Because of limited time, I won't demonstrate it today.",因为这一次因为时间的关系，就没有在这个会议上去使用，好吧。
"Now, I’ll talk about some new scenarios and challenges that we have encountered.",额下面跟大家说一下我碰到的这个新场景和挑战。
These scenarios and challenges actually come from far-field voice and voice wake-up.,新场景和挑战实际上在于远场和唤醒。
"As I mentioned before, the modeling capability and data accumulation for near-field voice recognition have reached a mature level. ",因为我们跟刚才跟大家说近场的这个语音识别的建模能力和这个额语这个数据的这个积累都已经达到了一个额比较好的比较成熟的状态。
"However, they are different for the far-field voice.",但是一到了远场就不一样了。
"In far-field, what's crucial is the capability of voice recognition.",到了远场，大家首先要比的是识音的能力。
"Far-field refers to the distance beyond one meter, three meters or five meters. ",远场我们的意思是说，在一米、三米和五米大概是这样的一个距离。
Some people believe it's beyond six meters or eight meters.,有的人说还是说还到六米啊、八米这样的一个距离。
"My microphone is in such a distance away from me, and I expect that you can recognize my voice when I speak.",我的麦克风离得是这么远，然后我在说说话的时候，额也希望你能够比较好的识别。
This is similar to our conversations in daily life. ,这个非常近似于额我们日常人跟人之间的对话是吧。
"When we talk with people face to face, we feel comfortable at a distance from one meter away.",我们人跟人之间的话，基本上就要站到一米开外，我们说话才会比较自然。
"Therefore, the first challenge is actually our capability of voice recognition.",所以这儿的话，实际上第一个挑战是对识音能力的挑战。
"Echoes come from a far distance, and far-field sounds bring echoes.",因为你一旦距离离得远了，你就会带来回响，就这个声音它是有这个带有一定的回回声的。
"Moreover, noises can easily come from a far distance.",另外的话，噪音可以特别容易地进来，因为你的这个空间远，所以你的这个噪音也会进来。
So different noises and reverberations are mixed to weaken your capability of voice recognition.,所以会有不同的噪音不同的这个混响，加在一起会对你的识音的能力，就变得非常的弱。
"In this case, we expect to have the capability to properly process signals of received sound waves.",所以这个时候就需要对额来的进收进来的这个声波进行非常好的信号处理的能力。
"This is not just a problem of voice recognition modeling, but a problem of whether you have a great signal processing capability.",这就不仅仅单单的是一个语音识别建模的一个问题了，而是一个看你信号处理的技术能力到底强还是不强的问题。
And the hardware different from such a microphone is also involved and called microphone array.,而且这里面又涉及到我们去用额跟这样麦克风不一样的硬件，就是叫这个麦克风阵列。
"It is a ring that can locate sounds, and can receive sound waves from a specific direction.",它去它是一个环，然后呢可以进行声位的判断，可以定向的去去收这个声波。
The quality of the received sound waves directly determines whether the recognition is accurate.,所以这个收的这个声波的质量的好坏直接决定了识别得准确还是不准确。
"Due to this new challenge, the core voice technology has gradually changed. ",所以在这个新的挑战下，语音的这个核心技术又慢慢地在转移。
It used to only involve recognition. ,它由一部分就是以前只是识别。
But now it involves two parts. ,但是呢现在变成了两个部分。
"One is digital signal processing, and the other one is voice recognition.",一部分是数字信号处理，另外一部分才是语音识别。
"If you fail to get these two parts perfect, you may fail to achieve good voice recognition.",所以这两部分你如果都做的不强，那你的这个识别就还是不好。
So it is a huge challenge for us.,所以这儿是一个我们看到的非常大的一个挑战。
Another challenge is wake-up.,另外一个就是唤醒。
The voice for wake-up comes from a natural state of our daily conversation.,因为唤醒是我们平常对话的时候是非常自然的一个状态。
"For example, if I want to talk with you, I will first call your name to get your attention.",譬如我要跟你说话，第一我要先说你的名字是吧，这样才能得到你的注意注意力。
The wake-up function works in the same way. ,那么唤醒也是一样的。
Our wake-up word is “Xiao Du”.,我们的唤醒词就是小度小度。
"If you don't say ""Xiao Du, Xiao Du"", the speaker or remote controller will not respond to your voice.",如果你不说小度小度，那么这个音箱或者一个一个什么遥控器什么的它就不会听你的声音。
"According to our experience, it is extremely difficult to make this function perfect. ",那么这个体验要做到极致，额被我们证明是一个非常非常难。
You have to put a huge amount of time and efforts in it for success.,也需要非常非常多时间投入才能够达到的一个水平。
"First, the wake-up function must be highly sensitive. ",就是第一你一定要唤醒要灵敏。
"If you call me and I respond in one or two seconds later, you may think that I'm stupid and not clever. ",因为如果唤醒以后我一到两秒以后才回答你，你会觉得我这个人可能比较笨，这个这个脑脑袋可能不太灵光。
This is the same for devices.,那么对于设备来讲也是一样。
"If you call the name of a device and the device replies you in two seconds later, you may think that this is a really stupid device.",如果一台任何一台设备，你叫它的名字，它隔两秒才回答你，你觉得这个设备真的是太笨了。
Another serious challenge is false wake-up.,另外一个非常难的东西，就是误唤醒。
"That is, I do not call you, but you think that I'm talking to you and start to recognize my voice. ",就是我没有叫醒你，你突然之间认为我在跟你这这个对对话，开始这个进行语音识别。
"Then, a terrible experience comes from this incident, including chatting and playing songs in the middle of the night.",然后呢又开始半夜的话，再说说话再播播歌，实际上对人的影响会特别的大。
It is also difficult to solve the problem for false wake-up because of various coming-in sounds.,误唤醒也是一个把它做到极致，也是一个非常难的问题，因为会有各种各样的声音进来。
"For example, if you turn on the television, you can hear various sounds from the TV program.",譬如你在放电视的时候，会有各种各样电视的声音。
"When you are at home, you may hear the sounds from cooking in the kitchen and voices from people in the living room.",你在家居的时候有这个炒菜的声音，有人说话的声音。
"We have this term called ""rejection"", which means to reject recognition. ",你都要把它做我们我们这个专业的额这个术语叫“拒识”。
It is very difficult to achieve a higher accuracy rate for rejection.,就是拒绝识别，把它做到非常准是非常难的。
"Now, we have achieved perfect functions for our best devices, but false wake-up still happens about every other day.",我们现在额我们最好的设备，我们把把这个性能做到极致，我们能做到两天有一次误唤醒就是它还会有误唤醒。
It is really difficult to overcome this challenge.,因为这个这个这个这个技术要打磨到极致真的是很难。
"In a noisy environment, we can guarantee that wake-up occurs by mistake once in a two-day period, and it reaches the extreme level for the existing technologies.",但是能做到两两天有一次误唤醒，就是后面有噪音一直在播，这个这个是目前技术能达到的极致。
"Last year, we did two things only. ",我们在最近的一年只做了这两件事情。
"One is for far-field recognition, and the other one is for wake-up.",一个是远场识别，一个是唤醒。
"We have undertaken a great number of projects and made many technical innovations, and now we are satisfied with our technologies.",我们经历了特别多，做了特别多的项目，额做了特别多的技术的创新，然后到今天基本上达到一个比较满意的状态。
These are the challenges I said before. ,这就是我刚才说的额这个挑战。
It is not easy to overcome them. ,非常的不容易。
"However, according to our experience, you can achieve a great user experience if you do a good job.",但是也证明额如果你做得好，用户的体验会非常的棒。
"That is, if you call it by name, it will say ""Master, what do you want to do?"" or ""Ok"", or ""Yes"". ",就是你话音刚落，它马上就额会说额“主人，您想要做什么样的事情？”，或者说“好的”，或者说“我在呢”。
That's really great as you have a considerate assistant to serve you at any time.,那个感觉真的是非常的好，觉得你真的身边有一个很贴心的助助手，在时时刻刻地愿意为你去服务。
"What I have talked about may be not enough, because many technologies are involved.",我不知道，可能不太够了啊，这个这块儿的这个技术的东西稍微多一些。
So I'd like to tell more about these technologies.,我跟大家再多说一点。
"One of the difficulties for voice wake-up is that you can't locate the sound source, because you do not know the direction of the coming sound.",就是额唤醒之所以难，还难还难在你无法事先判断这个声音是来自于什么样的方方向，所以你无法把它进行声源定位。
"Therefore, you have to constantly collect sounds from all directions, and determine whether the collected sounds are the wake-up words.",所以必须时时刻刻的在各个方向上去收收音，对收到的音进行判断，到底是不是诶我的唤醒唤醒词。
"After being waken up, you can determine the source of the sound and start recognizing voices from the specific direction.",但当你唤醒了以后，你就可以定定向地判断这个声音的来源，然后定向地进行语音的识别。
"So, signal processing is one of the key technologies for the far-field voice recognition.",所以在远在远场我们说这个信号信号处理技术是这个关键技术之一。
"Another technology named ""Beamforming"" is about locating phonemes, and it is also crucial.",就还有这个我们叫Beamforming，就是我们这个这个音素这个定向的技术，也是非常的关键的技术。
"If you deviate even a little bit, your ability for collecting sound may get much worse at a distance from three or five meters away. As an old Chinese saying goes, ""a miss is as good as a mile"".",你稍微偏那么一点儿，那么在三米或者五米开外，我们讲失之毫厘差之千里是吧，那么你收音的能力可能就会差很差很多。
"In the past year, we made many technological innovations on how to eliminate noises and echoes by means of digital signal processing, and how to how to perfectly locate the source of a sound.",所以如果如何通过数字信号处理把这些额消除噪音的技术，消除回声的技术，然后声源定位的技术做到极致，这个我们在去年一年做了非常非常多的技术的创这个各种各样的创新。
Let's watch another a video. ,以后再还有一个视频吧。
Please play it.,你给大家放放一下，工作人员给放一下。

"The farther you get away, the more difficult it will be for the machine to locate the sound.",因为这个就是没你你离得越远对于它的这个非常精确的定位，各种的话挑战就会比较大。
So it's really difficult to get this technology perfect.,所以这个技术做得好，还是非常的不容易。
"However, we find a great user experience, because we keep a certain distance with people in the daily conversation.",但是大家都看到了体验会很好，因为我们平时交流的时候就是隔着一定的距离。
Right?,对吧？
"In this way, you will feel that you are talking to a person instead of a device. ",这样的话你会感觉你是在跟一个人去说话，并不是在跟一个设备去说话。
This is a brand new user experience.,这是一种比较全新的这种用户的体验。

This is our data enhancement technology.,这个是我们做的数据增强的技术。
"In order to achieve higher accuracy of far-field recognition, we create enough far-field data by adding the recorded impulse response function to the near-field data.",就是我们为了把我们远场识别额做的足够得准，因为我们没有很多的远场这样的数据，但是我们可以把我们近场的数据加上我们的录制好的冲激响应函数，然后把它变成远场的数据。
The clip just played shows the near-field voice added with the impulse response in the room. ,所以刚才放的那个是我们近场语音，然后呢加上我们房房间的这个冲击响。
We can listen to it.,大家可以听一听。
"""Listen to a quiet song for good sleep.""",听一首安静的曲子好睡觉。
It sounds like a far-field voice. ,感觉就是一个远场的感觉了。

"In this way, we ensure that our accumulated near-field data can be used in our far-field model.",这样的话可以保证我们远场的模模型也能够用到我们近场这个上积累的这个数数据。
"""Listen to a quiet song for good sleep.""",听一首安静的曲子好睡觉。
It is slightly different from the real voice.,看跟真实的声音基本上没有太大的区别。
Another challenge comes from noise synthesis.,另外一个是我们噪声的合成。
"Stringent requirements are proposed for the noises in a car, because the car is full of various noises, especially when you drive on an expressway. ",因为在车载里面对于噪声的话要求是非常的高，因为车载里面永远是有各种各样的噪声的，尤其你在开高速的时候。
"Regardless of an open or closed window or other situations, noises always exist, and so they need to be synthesized as well.",你在开窗或者关窗各种各样不同情况下，噪声永远是有，所以噪声也得合成。
Play a song of Jay Chou.,播放周杰伦的歌。
The environment is quiet. ,这是安静的。
Now we add the noises arising from a car into it.,然后呢我们把这个车载的噪声加进去。
Play a song of Jay Chou.,播放周杰伦的歌。

"Recently, we have released the updated Baidu Map, which is fully hands-free. ",另外我们的地图，我们地图最近刚刚发了一版新的，就是叫全面的Hands-Free。
"When using this Baidu Map, you don't need to hold it. ",就是你用百度地图，你只要放在那儿，就再也不用手啦。
All operations are carried out by means of voice instructions.,额所有的对于百度地图的操作，在车里面全部是通过语音的。
This is our new technology.,这个都是额我们带给大家的新的技术。
This is what I talked about just now.,这就是我刚才说的。
"In addition, errors can be corrected according to the voice prompt for our input method, which was made available online long ago.",另外我们输入法的话也可以根据语音进行纠错，这个我们也已经很早就上上线了。
"For example, if there is a typo, you can say that “the Chinese character for ‘Bing’ in Fan Bingbing’s name is not the one indicating soldier in Chinese, but the one indicating ice"". ",就是如果某一个字错了的话，你可以说那个就比如说额不是范冰冰的冰，额是那个当兵的兵。

What Qingxiang said really made me think a lot.,因为庆祥的话确实让我有非常多的感慨。
I feel that it reminds me of a voice that I often used seven or eight years ago but now is lost to me.,我觉得好像让我想起了一种大概七八年前我经常会使用，但现在忘记使用的一个语态。
"It was an approach of expression, full of intense emotions, delivered in a collective and excited way.",用一种非常集体性的，嗯亢奋式的嗯就充满了强烈的热情式的表述方式。
"Of course, I believe every generation is different.",当然我觉得每一代人。
"And we two are not much different in age, about four or five years.",当然我们俩人之间差得并不多嘛，差四五岁左右。
But we're like two watersheds.,但是像两个分分水岭一样。
So why does he make me to remind you of this?,他让我提醒这些是什么原因呢？
"I think maybe every generation has the desire to exaggerate its own importance, and even to exaggerate its incompetence and suffering.",我想我想可能每一代人都有夸张自己重要性的欲望、渴望，甚至自己的无能和受苦都有被夸张的欲望。
"Every generation lives in a sense of emptiness where the old world has perished, but the new world has yet to be built, as described by Matthew Arnold.",每一代人都生活在马修·阿诺德所说的旧的世界已经灭亡，但新的世界尚未建立的这种空洞感之中。
"This kind of feeling persists for a century, reflected in the new cultural movement mentioned earlier by Mr. Ma Yong, in the anger and cry of Chinese college students in the 1980s, and in the sorrow of the people born in the 1980s.",这种感受也是过去一个世纪以来，从马勇先生开始讲的新文化运动，八十年代的中国大学生的愤怒和呐喊，到此刻80后的悲哀。
"What is consistent throughout the twentieth century, you will find, is the individual consciousness that has yet to be awakened.",你会发现贯穿二十世纪，一以贯之的是个人意识的某种尚未觉醒。
"Young people in the 1920s wanted to break free from family ethics and social pressures, like Nora wants to run away from the Doll's House, but what can they do after that?",二十年代的年轻人想从那些家庭伦理，想从社会压力中摆脱出来，他们说要“娜拉”要出走，但是出走之后怎么办？
"I never thought that nearly a hundred years later, a new generation of young people still feel that they are under control, and they cannot really develop their personal art.",没想到过了将近一百年，新一代年轻人仍然会感觉到自己受到所有的事的控制，自己的个人艺术无法得到真正的生长。
I think it may be a huge sorrow for several generations of intellectuals including us who are talking about this issue today.,我觉得这也可能是几代知识分子，包括我们今天在谈论这个问题的一种巨大的悲哀。
It seems as if we have fallen into a heart-wrenching vicious circle of history.,好像我们掉入了一个非常让人心痛的一个历史的怪圈里面。
Every generation often does not even know that they are trapped in the predicament of history.,然后经常每一代人甚至不知道自己受限于历史的困境。
"They think that they have entered a new era and suffered new pains, but all the pains are no more than relics and remains from the past.",以为自己进入一个新时代，以为自己受了崭新的痛苦，但自己所有的痛苦只不过过去的某种传承和遗弃遗迹。
Enough with the digression.,啊前面这个题外话先说一点。
"Let's come back to what I am going to talk about today, which are the episodes during my trips over the past few years.",然后回到我今天要讲的主题，过去几年来我旅行的几个插曲。
One of them was my first trip to Vietnam in 2005.,一个是2005年的时候我第一次去越南旅行。
"I took a minibus in Guangxi and traveled through the narrow northern tip of Vietnam, which is shaped like a shoulder pole, to Hanoi.",越南，从广西坐着中巴车穿过非常狭长的像扁担一样形状的越南的北部，去往河内。
"Vietnam was going through new political and economic changes at that time, so I wondered what the country would look like.",当时的越南正在发生一些新的政治和经济的变化，我非常好奇这个国家变成什么样子。
Then in Hanoi I met with the Vietnamese female writer in the cafe opposite to the hotel where Graham Green wrote Quiet American.,然后在越南的河内，在当年写出了《安静的美国人》格雷厄姆·格林的那个酒店的对面那个咖啡馆里面，我见到了当时那个越南女作家。
I have forgotten her name because it's hard to pronounce.,她名字很难发音我已经忘记了。
"She is probably known as Wei Hui of Vietnam, manifesting younger generation's bold opinions on sex, social changes and politics in Vietnam.",她大概号称是越南的卫慧，是一个新表现越南年轻一代大胆的对性，对社会变化，对政治态度的一个女性作家。
She is very gentle and gracious.,长得非常的温柔贤淑。
We talk about the relationship between China and Vietnam with the help of an interpreter.,借助一个中间的翻译，然后我们谈起中越两国的关系。
She proposed a very interesting idea that I had never thought about before.,她非常她提出了一个非常有趣的看法，我从来没有想过。
"She said that in Vietnamese literature, especially in the love stories, the mighty hero coming from the north is often Chinese, and the heroine, often Vietnamese, was alway in distress, capitivated or had to please the man.",她说在我们越南的文学作品之中，很多讲就男女关系的爱情小说里面，那个代表着强大的北方来的男人的形象是来自是中国人，而越南在小说中永远都是代表一个受困的、被俘获的或者是取悦这个北方男人的女性的形象。
This example astonished me.,这个例子让我大吃一惊。
"Because in the literary works that we often saw from the era of the early twentieth century to the time of Wei Hui, the powerful male image was always westerners from Europe or the United States, while Chinese women were pictured as weak, trying to please others.",因为在我们所有习惯的叙事之中，我们看到的不管是二十世纪早期一直到卫慧的时代，其中强大的男性形象是西方人，他们来自欧洲或者来自美国，东方女性中国女性是一个弱小的形象，她们是个取悦者的姿态。
"But in Vietnam, it's a different case.",但在越南，所有的这个类比发生了变化。
We represented a new kind of intruders or a powerful image.,我们代表一种新的入侵者或者一种强大的形象。
You will definitely see Confucius Temples in Hanoi.,然后在河内你当然会看到那些孔庙。
Confucius has a deep influence in Vietnam.,孔当然孔子儒家在越南有很深的影响。
"The image of Confucius there is of course Vietnamese, not the image of the Shandong people we are familiar with or the images from other places.",孔庙里面孔子的形象当然是一幅越南人的形象，不是我们熟悉看到的山东人的形象或者是别的地方的形象。
You can always see the records of  how China invaded Vietnam in their history books.,然后在越南的史书里面看到不断的是中国如何入侵越南的印记和这个记载。
This is the first example.,这是第一个例子。
"At that time I was less than 30 and I clearly realized for the first time that for the surrounding small countries, China represents a different image from what I thought it would be, very different.",这是我第一次当时我三十不到嘛，第一次清晰地意识到，对于周边的临近的小国，中国代表着形象跟我想象的不太一样，或者非常不一样。
The second example was my trip to Myanmar about two years ago.,第二个例子大概发生在两年多前我去缅甸旅行。
Myanmar was undergoing tremendous changes.,缅甸那时候正在发生巨大的变化。
"The NLD led by Aung San Suu Kyi started their election campaign, and the society began to loosen.",昂山素季领导的NLD，她们开始要参与选举，社会开始变得松动起来。
"Then we witnessed the dramatic change of Myanmar, which transformed from a long-time dictatorial and sleeping society to a less fearful and freer one.",然后我们看着缅甸在发生这个戏剧性变化，从一个漫长的、独裁的、沉睡的一个社会中，向一个更少恐惧的、更自由的社会转变之中。
"Another thing local Myanmese will talk about is the so-called Chinese Expeditionary Force, which is also an example we will easily recall when we go to Myanmar.",而中国在，而又是一个当地的缅甸人会讲起，我们会因为去缅甸我们会非常容易想起一个例子，就是所谓的中国的远征军嘛。
They opened up new battlefields in Myanmar.,他们在缅甸开辟了新的战场。
They were important forces in World War II but they were tragic.,他们是二战中重要的力量，而且充满了悲壮。
Eventually they seemed to be abandoned.,最终似乎被遗弃这么一个形象。
But many people in Myanmar told me that they were filled with some kind of anger that could not be expressed to the so-called Chinese Expeditionary Force.,但在缅甸的很多人跟我讲，他们对于所谓的远征军心里充满了某种无法表达的愤怒。
Because the Chinese Expeditionary Force was an invading army in their mind.,因为远征军对他们来说是一个入侵的军队。
"They had long been ruled by British colonists, and with the arrival of the Japanese, they had completed a new alliance with Japan.",他们曾经长期受英国殖民者的统治，日本人的到来，他们和日本完成了一种新的同盟。
"The so-called  General Aung San, Aung San Suu Kyi’s father, was in a very close relationship with the Japanese.",现在所谓的昂山素季的父亲昂山将军，他是跟日方是一个非常亲密的关系。
They wanted to unite to drive away the British colonists.,他们要联合起来赶走英国殖民者。
The arrival of the Chinese army was thought to be an invasion from the north.,而中国军队的到来是一个北方的入侵者。
"Also because of the failure of the Chinese Civil War, a large number of Kuomintang troops were stranded in the northern part of Myanmar.",同时因为国共战争的失败，大批的国民党军队就滞留在缅甸的北部。
We now know the so-called drug traffickers as well as military regimes in the Golden Triangle.,所以我们现在知道金三角的一带所谓贩毒也好包括军事政权。
They believe that the existence of the Kuomintang army had made it impossible for Myanmar to complete the process of national independence and national unity.,他们认为这批国民党军队的存在使得缅甸永远始终无法完成一个民族独立、国家完整统一的过程。
"It also became a strong excuse for them, making the military government rule the country in a long term.",它也使军政府变得长期的可以统治这个国家，变成了他们的某种强烈的一个借口。
This is the second point.,这是第二点。
"It suddenly comes to my mind that the image of China that we are familiar with, the army that you think is tragic or victorious, is an intruder in their eyes, an obstructor of their national unity.",然后我突然意识到我们所熟悉的中国的形象，你认为是悲壮的或是胜利式的这么一个军队形象，在他们眼中是这么一个入侵者，是一个阻碍了他们的国家统一的这么一个力量。
The third example was a trip to Singapore in October.,第三个例子，那就刚刚十月份在新加坡的旅行。
"Singapore has somewhat hard feelings towards China, due to whatever reason or their own narrow-mindedness,  not only to Chinese tourists but also to the whole China.",当然新加坡是一个不管出于什么原因或者出于他们内在的某种城市的狭隘性也好，他们充满了一种强烈的对中国，不仅是中国游客对整个中国的某种抵抗的一个情绪。
"They laugh at the so-called new Chinese tourists who buy everything, behave rudely, spit everywhere, and whose children are noisy.",嘲笑所谓的新型的中国游客他们什么都买，他们举止粗俗，他们随地吐痰，他们小孩子大吵闹。
"Such an image becomes part of their daily life, which makes me very uncomfortable.",这样的一个形象变成了他们日常生活中的一部分，这让我非常不舒服。
"But at the same time, you feel that  people in such a remote and small country have a huge anxiety about China's rise, and we are unaware of  it.",但同时你就感觉到在遥远的这么一个小国新加坡，他们对于中国崛起产生的一个巨大的焦虑，和我们对于这种焦虑的浑然不觉。
And I find something very interesting when I looked at Lee Kuan Yew’s memoirs.,其中我在翻看李光耀的回忆录的时候看到一个非常有趣的一个插曲。
"In 1978, when China just started reform and opening up, Mr.Deng Xiaoping paid a visit to Lee Kuan Yew.",1978年，当中国刚刚开始改革开放的时候。邓小平先生去见了李光耀。
"Deng Xiaoping was looking forward to forming a new alliance with Singapore to fight against the expansion of the Soviet Union, which was significant for the entire Asia.",邓小平当时非常期待跟新加坡完成一种新的联盟，他们说对亚洲而言，我们要一起来结成新的联盟来对抗苏联的扩张。
"But to his surprise, the meeting with Lee Kuan Yew was completely different from what he expected.",但他万万没有想到李光耀的会晤却跟他想得完全不同。
"Lee Kuan Yew said,""what we are most concerned and worried about in the entire Southeast Asia is the Communist forces of Myanmar and Malaysia, which are supported by China.",他李光耀说对于我们整个东南亚世界，最让我们感到忧虑和担心的是来自于中国所支持的所有的这些缅甸的、马来西亚的这些共产党力量。
"It is these communist forces of Southeast Asia that make these countries be caught in constant turmoil.""",是这些支持的这些所谓的东南亚的共产主义势力，使这些国家陷入经常性的动荡。
It is these words that made Deng Xiaoping rethink the relationship between China and the outside world.,也是这句话让邓小平重新去思考中国和外部的关系。
"I think few people still remember this, but it fully indicates how insensitive we Chinese were to what the outside world think of us.",我想很少人现在记得这个例子，但这个例子非常地充分地表明中国对于外界如何感知自己是一个多么强的一个迟钝感。
And we are still insensitive today.,这种迟钝感延迟到今。
"With the strong insensibility towards the world, China now is undergoing rapid economic growth and great social changes, and we have exported this great power to many places.",我想对世界的某种强烈的迟钝，此刻的中国不仅是在看到中国内部经济的高速成长，社会的巨大变迁，而且我们已经把这个巨大的力量已经输出到很多地方。
"In Africa, we have a lot of investment and immigrants; in Latin America, we have bought mines and built new canals; and we are everywhere in Southeast Asia.",在非洲，我们有大量的投资、大量的移民；在拉丁美洲，我们买下矿山，建造新的运河；然后在东南亚更是无处不在。
"But we seldom consider what damage we will bring to the world with our lifestyles, our value standard, the principles we stick to, or the principle that we have no principle.",但是我们很少思考我们这套我们的生活方式、我们的价值标准、我们坚持的原则或者我们没有任何原则的这种原则，对于世界带来某种什么样的损伤。
"Young people of your generation nowadays traveled extensively around the world, many may think that you are embracing globalization; but acturally China knows little about the outside world, and even insensitive to it.",尽管此刻，你们这代年轻人大量地前往世界各地去旅行，大量地所谓地融入到全球化进程之中，但实际上中国对整个外部世界是知之甚少，甚至抱有一种非常迟钝性的心态。
And this feeling is what the writer Bo Yang has described in the book that I want to talk about today.,而这种感受正是今天我要跟你谈的这本书，就这位作家柏杨所当年描绘的另一种翻版。
"In 1985, he published his little book of prose entitled ""The Ugly Chinaman"" simultaneously in Taiwan and on the mainland.",在1985年的时候，在台湾、在大陆同时出版了他的一本薄薄的散文集，叫《丑陋的中国人》。
Bo Yang was a very important prose writer in the 20th century.,柏杨是一位二十世纪非常重要的一个散文作家。
He went to Taiwan with the Kuomintang army in 1949 and he was a satirist.,他在1949年随着国民党军队去了台湾，在台湾他是一位讽刺作家。
"He once translated an interesting comic book ""The Popeye"" in which there is a story about a father and son trying to run for president on the island.",当年因为翻译一个有趣的《大力水手》的漫画，《大力水手》冲间中间的漫画有一次在讲到在一个岛上一对父子试图去竞选岛上的总统。
"This was a very funny cartoon, and Bo Yang translated one of its lines into ""all compatriots, how do we run for president.""",然后这是一个非常搞笑的漫画，然后柏杨在其中翻成了“所有的国民同胞们，我们要怎么样竞选总统。”
It was an expression that Chiang Kai-shek liked to use most at the time.,这是当时蒋介石最喜欢用的语句。
This translation was regarded as a symbol of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo's dictatorship in Taiwan.,他这样一个翻译被说成了是蒋介石、蒋经国父子独裁台湾的一个象征。
He was thus put in prison and spent nearly a decade on Green Island.,他因此被投入了监狱，在绿岛中度过了将近十年的生活。
"After he was released, he continued being a satirist like before.",在他出狱之后，他继续成为一个这样的一个讽刺者。
"Then in 1982 and 1983, he gave several lectures at Tunghai University in Taiwan and the University of Iowa in the United States.",然后在82，83年的时候他在台湾的东海大学、在美国的爱荷华大学连续做过几场演讲。
The topics were all about The Ugly Chinaman.,这演讲题目都是关于《丑陋的中国人》。
People will feel nothing strange or special when we re-read it now.,如果如今翻起来这里面没有什么大家感觉到陌生和特殊的东西。
"It describes the absence of public order, social morality, sense of solidarity and public spirit in Chinese people's lives, which remains in today's Chinese society.",讲到中国人的生活的怎么说缺乏秩序、不排队、缺乏公德心、呃没有团结能力、没有公共精神，所有这一切在此刻的中国社会仍然有很多反映。
"But when he expressed the idea, he followed the style originated from the ""ugly"" series popular in the United States and Japan at that time, include the Ugly Americans and Ugly Japanese.",但在那一刻，当他表达出这样的个理念的时候，这本书也是源自于当时在美国、日本都流行一时的一种风格，就所谓的“丑陋的”系列，和《丑陋的美国人》、丑陋的《丑陋的日本人》。
The Ugly Chinaman written by him is consistent with the spirit of self-criticism in Chinese tradition.,他写了《丑陋的中国人》，是一种延续了也是延续了中国传统中的自我批评。
Bo Yang just followed Lun Xun's footsteps to explore Chinese nationality.,是鲁迅对于中国国民性的观察，他延续这个传统而已。
"But this book caused a huge shock in China in the 1980s, which was related to the overall social sentiment at the time.",但这本书在八十年代的中国引起巨大的一个震荡，这个震荡是跟当时整个的社会情绪有关。
"In the 1980s after the huge turmoil of Cultural Revolution,we suddenly found that after a 30-year social experiment, everything in China had become even more backward.",这个情绪八十年代的中国经过文革的一个巨大的动荡之后，我们突然发现我们在进行了一场巨大的社会实验之后的三十年之后，中国的一切反而更加落后了。
"Therefore, a strong self-criticism permeated throughout the 1980s.",所以整个八十年代强充满了一种强烈的自我批判的精神。
The Ugly Chinaman and the TV serials River Elegy three years later both conveyed such a spirit.,《丑陋的中国人》和三年之后的《河殇》电视片《河殇》都是这样的一种精神的延续。
"Chinese intellectuals, especially young people at the time were eager to know what happened in this country, what happened in the superficial political system as well as the deep cultural structure.",当时的中国的知识分子，包括这些当时的中国年轻人都会去追问这个国家发生了什么，不仅是表层的政治制度而且是深层的文化结构发生了什么样的事情。
This book was of the most striking extension of that sentiment at that time.,这本书是当时这种情绪的最显著的一个延伸。
But this kind of inquiry came to an abrupt end after 1989 because we entered a new era.,当然这场追问在1989年之后非常的戛然而止了。
"It is an era of rapid economic growth, an economy-centered era.",我们进入了一个新时代，这个时代是一个所谓的经济高速成长，一切以它为中心的时代。
"Other social strengths, such as ethical and cultural values Qingxiang just mentioned are suppressed and underestimated in a sense.",而我们其它的社会的力量，刚才庆祥讲的伦理的价值、文化的价值都在一个新的时代被某种意义上压抑了、被低估了。
We are now entering such a new era.,此刻我们进入这么一个新的时代。
"When I read this book again thirty years later, I was very surprised to find everything that Bo Yang describes, everything that Sun Yatsen and Liang Qichao had complained about, is still going on in current society.",三十年之后我重新翻阅这本书的时候，非常惊讶地发现，柏杨所描述的一切，这个一切是从孙中山开始的抱怨，从梁启超的抱怨开始，描述的一切在此刻的中国仍然在继续发生。
"And since China is emerging as a new and powerful force in the world, all the defects he complains about are brought to the rest of the world, appearing in a new way with obvious arrogance.",而因为中国正在崛起为世界新的一个巨大的强权力量，他抱他所抱怨的所有的这些缺陷，它们被带到了世界各地，它们会以一种崭新的方式出现了，而且这种方式带有非常明显的傲慢的姿态。
"Bo Yang likes to make an analogy in his book, comparing Chinese culture to a huge sauce jar.",柏杨在他的书中喜欢做一个类比，这个类比是中文中国文化像某个巨大的一个酱缸一样。
We live in it and we are constantly polluted by it.,我们在生活在其中，我们被这个酱缸不断地污染。
"I think in essence, his ""sauce jar"" refers to China's long-standing authoritarian culture in the traditional sense.",我想在本质而言，他所谓的酱缸是中国传统意义上漫长的专制文化。
"It represses the growth of personality and the growth of personal spirit, and this repression still at this moment, continues.",这个专制文化压抑人的个性的真正成长，也压抑所谓的呃个人精神的一个成长，而这种压抑在此刻它仍然延续着。
But the new sauce jar we see sometimes look like a gold-plated sauce jar because of the advent of the gilded age and the great power of money.,但因为巨大的镀金时代的到来，巨大金钱力量的到来，我们看到的新的酱缸，有时候看起来像一个镀金的酱缸。
"The most dangerous thing is that living in the gold-plated sauce jar, we become more content with what we are doing and more convinced that it is reasonable.",而此刻最危险的时候事情发生的是，生活在这个镀金的酱缸之中，我们对自己的所有的行为更为甘之如饴，甚至更为甚至认为它相信它更有道理了。
It's another kind of arrogance.,我们带着某种新的傲慢。
"The ugly Chinaman in the 1980s tended to be more defensive, because the long-term turmoil and social disruption caused a certain will to live, a huge defensive panic.",八十年代的丑陋的中国人带有某种防守的姿姿势，是因于因源于我们长期的动荡，长期的社会的分裂感造成的某种生存意志，一种巨大的慌张，防卫性的。
"But at this moment, many people turn to be more offensive and less introspective in the new gold-plated sauce jar.",但此刻在新的这个镀金的酱缸中，我觉得很多人的感受是一种更为进攻性的，更缺乏自省式的方式了。
"Southeast Asian people's feeling about China and their understanding of China's image, which I talked about earlier, are all extension of Chinese people's characteristics that have been re-expanded.",刚而我刚才谈到的东南亚世界他们对于中国的感受，对于中国形象的理解，都是一个重新被扩张的所谓的中国人的特性的延伸。
"So for our generation and your generation, perhaps the most important mission is to re-understand the relationship between China and the world, and to create a new understanding of ourselves in this process.",所以对于我们这代人，你们代这代人，可能最重要的一个使命是如何重新理解中国和世界的关系，在这种重新理解之中产生一种新的对自我的理解。
"I find that from the time of Bo Yang to the present, one of the most dramatic changes in China is that the voice of self-reflection and self-criticism within the sosiety has gradually faded.",我想从柏杨时代到现在，整个中国发生最戏剧性的变化之一就是，这个社会内部反省的声音、自我批评的声音逐渐地消沉了。
"Instead, there comes out a very noisy voice of self-forgiveness and self-satisfication.",取而代之的是一种非常喧闹的、自我原谅的、自我满足的声音。
And there is no re-involvement of the relationship between China and the world at this moment.,而且这里没有重新涉及到中国对此刻中国和世界的关系。
"In my view, China's influence on the world, at this moment, is more of a hype than a real impact on values.",我想中国对世界的影响，在此刻我想更像是一种带来喧嚣式的影响，而不是真正的一种价值上的影响。
I think life is short.,我觉得人这一生很短暂。
"Of scores of problems we have to solve in this short life, learning is one which all of us cannot neglect.",我们有很多的问题要面对，其中学习就是我们每一个人都无法忽视的一个大问题。
"Either as a kid or an adult, we all have to keep learning as a way to maintain our vitality.",不管是小孩子还是成人，我们都要不断地学习来保持我们的活力。
"I do not know if you can still remember that when we were in our childhood, all almost every one of us, at least me, would raise a hand every time our teacher posed the question ""Can anyone answer my question?""",不知道大家还记得否，当我们还是小孩子的时候，如果老师问说“哪位小朋友可以回答我的问题呀？”每一个小朋友，至少我，一定是高高地举起自己的小手。
"Looking around the classroom, I found all children in the classroom had raised their hand.",我们环顾一下教室四周发现真的，班级里的小朋友们都举起了手。
Why are children so active?,为什么？为什么孩子们这么积极？
This is because they are simple and straightforward.,那是因为，孩子们很简单、很直接，
" If they knew the answer, they would say they know, and if they don’t know, they would say they don’t know. ",他们知道就是知道，不知道就是不知道，
They have no qualms about asking questions.,想回答他就回答，他没有任何的顾忌。
"However, as we get older, when we enter middle school and university, and on some social occasions that require someone to answer a question, only when the teacher or the host call someone's name could he get the answer. ",可是随着我们年龄慢慢地增长、慢慢地推移，有没有发现当我们到了中学到了大学，甚至到了社会上一些也是需要人去问去回答的场合的时候，恐怕老师只有通过点名，才能获得他的答案了。
What lies behind this phenomenon?,这又是为什么？
Was it imputable to our vanity that grows with age as we become increasingly engaged in social activities?,是不是因为我们越来越多地接触了社会，我们渐渐地就拥有了一种叫虚荣心的东西。
"In fact, we began to be concerned with the outcomes.",我们开始在乎这个玩意儿。
"The concern is that if I gave a bad answer, would I lose face or would my image be tarnished in the eyes of others. ",如果我答得不够好，会不会没面子，会不会影响我在别人心目当中的那个形象。
"To put it more exactly, it is the image that you suppose others have of you that you fear might be distained.",准确地讲，是你希望别人认为你的那个形象。
"When I was a student, I kept no secrets from my roommates and classmates. ",我们在上学的时候，如果我们有同学啊，室友啊，大家都无话不谈，非常的真诚。
And we studied together and hung out together. ,可以一块学习、一块儿玩儿。
"However, after we started working, when asked by our colleagues: ""What will you do this weekend?""",但是当我们步入了职场，有些时候同事问你：“哟，周末你干嘛呀？”
"You might reply: ""well, I am too tired this week, so I just want to stay at home."" or ""I feel like to do some shopping"".",“累！累坏了！我歇歇在家里头。”或者说“逛逛街吧。”
 It is reasonable that all we want to do is to relax after a busy week of work.,对吧，忙那么累，弄那么累干嘛？
"As a matter of fact, some may avail themselves of their spare time to learn some new skills.",其实呢，说不定有些人已经用业余的时间使劲去充充电，学习各种新玩意儿去。
"Nonetheless, why do they choose to veil the truth?",可是他为什么不愿意说实话呢？
I suppose there are two reasons behind this.,原因无非两个。
One is that you have not truly mastered the new skills and are afraid of being ridiculed by others due to a lack of confidence. ,要么是你没自信，你觉得自己学不好别人会嘲笑你；
The other one is you are so confident. ,要么就是你太自信了。
You worry that the fact of you mastering new skills will apply more pressure on your peers and make you seem difficult to work with.,你担心别人知道你可以学得特别好，给别人压力，不好处。
"When we set our foot into a new industry, we have no hesitation in asking questions if we do not know the answer to a question.",当我们进入一个新行业的时候，往往不知道就去问，从来都没有任何的顾忌。
"But, after we scored some achievements, held some important positions and enjoyed higher status, especially when others tell you so, you might be afraid of asking questions. ",可是慢慢的，当我们有了一点成绩，甚至拥有一些职位儿，还拥有了一些身份的时候，尤其是当别人说，你是拥有一些成绩的，你是拥有一定身份和地位儿的，你开始特别害怕。
"Particularly, under no conditions will you ask your inferiors questions for the fear of being embarrassed.",如果碰到了一些问题的话，绝对不会问比自己身份低的，因为你害怕他知道你不知道这件事情，那很糗。
"In this way, we seem to wear a mask that covers our pure intents of learning.",慢慢的我们每一个人，好像似乎就带上了一张面具，我们曾经纯真的、活泼的学习状态变成了面具下的学习。
"Despite this, is learning an inherent need of human beings just like eating or sleeping?",那么到底，学习有没有本质的、真正的，就像我们吃、就像我们睡一项本能的需求呢？
"To answer this question, I want to share with you two small stories.",我想到了两个小故事，我想跟大家分享一下。
The first one is about my father.,第一个故事是关于我父亲。
My father was a well–known Erhu master in our city. ,我父亲是我们那个城市十里八乡公认的二胡高手，他拉琴拉得可好了，
"Not only did he play the two-stringed bowed instrument well, but also he have taught a large number of students, many of which have won big prizes in major cities such as Beijing, some therefore took an artistic path.",不光他自己的二胡造诣高，而且他教了很多的孩子，很多的孩子在北京好多城市拿了大奖，而且从此走上了艺术之路。
But actually my father has never received any professional training. ,但是我的父亲，却的的确确不是科班儿出身。
"To be exact, he managed to become an expert of Erhu totally by his own efforts.",准确地讲，百分之一百二自学。
"Born in a family engaged in salt business, my father is surrounded, if you could imagine, by workers employed to make salt.",因为我的父亲出生自一个盐厂家庭，不知道大家有没有这种概念，身边都是晒盐的工人。
"For those workers, what matters most is to be muscular and have great physical strength so that they can do as much work as possible.",对于那群工人们来说，他们认为最有价值的事情就是虎背熊腰、胳膊粗、力气大，干活一个顶俩。
"However, my father was not interested in all of this. ",可是我爸偏偏不喜欢这些。
"In his spare time, he would sit on piles of bags containing salt and learn Erhu on his own, playing what he has heard on the radio.",他没事儿就跑到那一坨一坨的盐堆上，就是那种晒盐的、堆盐的盐堆上，就开始拉二胡，自学，用他在收音机里头听到的东西来自己演奏。
"As you can imagine, in a salt plant without any acoustic shielding board, every time the instrument was played, the tune resounded throughout the village.",大家知道在盐厂那种地方是没有任何遮挡的，琴声一扬起，基本上是十里八乡全部都听得到。
The villagers were pretty worried for my grandfather for fear that my father might not be able to stay on track.,十里八乡的人都为我爷爷着急呀，他们害怕我爸爸走错道。

I will tutor you personally after school, free of charge.""",上完之后，我的那个美术老师，那个长得还有点矬，而且邋里邋遢的，这个讲起话来还有点大舌头的美术老师就把我留下来，他说：“付彩瑞，来来来，这个你想不想跟我学画画儿，只要你每天下了课之后，就过来，我就给你单独辅导，不收钱的。”

"At hearing of my question, my father replied: ""What is more important than mastering Math, Physics and Chemistry nowadays? How much difference does art make?""",然后我父亲说：“在这个年代还有什么比学好数理化更重要？谁还玩艺术？”

It was at that very moment that an ambition popped into my head. ,可是那一刻我知道，我的热血已经不仅是往上涌了。
And I determined that I would spend the rest of my life working in the Internet industry.,我知道这辈子，我就干定你了，互联网。
I don't know what is on your mind now.,此刻不知道大家在想一些什么？
"Now matter how old we are, perhaps all of us have been forced to abandon some passions due to some practical and social reasons. For example, we had to forego what we loved to do as pupils in order to enter junior high school and when preparing for the Gaokao, the National College Entrance Exam, we had to stay highly focused and not to be distracted by our passions.",你们，你们，你们以及你们，在我们每一个人成长的路上，不管我们多大年纪了，有没有过一些我们年少时因为一些实实在在的原因，一些社会的原因，比如说我们为了上中学，我们不得不放弃小学里头所喜欢的一些事情，而我们为了准备高考不得不收心。
"Finally we are in college, with a view to securing a decent job, we often choose to take part in the postgraduate entrance exams at graduation. ",可是我们好不容易进入大学了，毕业之后为了找一个更好的工作我们要去考研。

"Afterwards, her English dream was delayed because work consumed much of her time.",而且以后投入了工作，忙碌，总是没有时间，静下来去来完圆了这个梦。
"Following her retirement, she even planned to take part in a English training class. ",一直到退休，本来想要要么出去，去找一个培训班什么的。
"Unfortunately, she also abandoned this plan for the fear that a old woman in her 60s might embarrass her classmates.",又担心自己六十来岁了，会不会给周围的年轻人造成太大的困扰。
"Right about the time she felt she would never achieve this dream, her daughter gave her a Study Card.",就在她认为她永远也不可能实现这个年少的梦的时候，她的女儿给她塞了一张学习卡。
"Using an anonymous ID, she could say whatever she wanted to say and learn whatever she was interested in, without letting others know that she was a woman in her 60s. ",然后她到了网上之后发现，原来没有人知道她是个六十几岁的老太太，大家用的都是匿名的ID，她想说什么说什么，想学什么学什么。
"Sometimes, the teacher even said she had done a fantastic job in her study.",而且经常有老师夸她说，哎呀这位同学学得真好。
"When she announced that she was aged around 60, everyone was shocked.",当她说我是一位六十岁的老太太的时候，所有人都很惊讶。
"She felt really happy because she could finally take off her ""mask"" and indulge herself in learning English, without any burden. ",她觉得真的好开心，她觉得她终于可以卸下一切的面具，没有任何的负担。
She could learn whatever she wants and she is doing a great job.,她想怎么学她就怎么学，她可以学得非常的好。
"As we all know, the ability of learning varies from people.",唉，大家都知道每一个人的学习的能力并不尽相同。
"Some children might not be willing to go to classroom by reason of personality, family and teaching modes of their parents.",有很多的小孩子由于性格的原因，由于家庭的原因，由于父母教学方式的一个原因，他们可能不愿意去教室了，为什么？
"Some smarter students might think the teacher is giving lessons at a much slow pace, but others with a poorer ability to learn may struggle catching up with the teacher.",因为聪明的孩子觉得老师讲得太慢，然后稍微差一点的孩子觉得这个讲得又太快。

"For those with a poorer learning ability, they could just learn one lesson in two days.",慢的学的这个，两天学一课。
"Fortunately, by virtue of the Internet, we can find a way of learning that befits our unique characters.",终于有一天，到了网上碰在一块的时候，大家可以各自干各自的了。
This is how we remove our masks and learn in our own ways.,这就是卸下面具，使用我们各自的方式去学习。
"I just wrote off stage that ""TnDao is a good thing"".",我刚刚在台下写了一句话叫“听道好东西”。
"What do I want to say is that if you hear something useful in TnDao, then TnDao is a good thing.",什么意思呢？如果你在这个平台里听到了一些好的东西，那么“听道”就是个好东西。
"So, if there is something that you wanted to learn but never did, just do it.",各位，如果你曾经有过想学一些东西但是没有完成的话，赶紧去做吧！
"In this short life, if we do not rush to do what we like, we might never have the chance.",人生苦短，时间不久，再不学就没有机会啦。
Thank you for bearing with me.,最后感谢大家听我扯这么多，谢谢。
"Good evening, everyone!",大家晚上好！
My topic today is: There is no arts after the Song and Yuan dynasties in China.,我今天的题目叫：中国，宋元以后没有艺术。
This is a topic that even myself refused to admit in the past.,这是我自己都不肯承认的一个话题，我过去。
"I started to learn painting since I was very young, and the ancient arts of China was my favorite.",我记得从小学画画，那么爱中国的古代艺术。
"At that time, if someone told me that there was no arts after the Song and Yuan dynasties, I would definately fight with him, regardless of how slim my chance of winning might be.",谁要跟我说宋元以后没有艺术，我跟他干，干不过也干。
"However, after several years of learning, comparing and thinking, I became old enough to know that my father was actually not so robust and invincible as I thought in my childhood.",但是没办法，经过这么多年的学习、对比、思考，我就像一个长大的孩子，我终于明白，我爹他不是那个孔武有力，战无不胜的男人。
"No matter how he wanted to protect me, he couldn't always win in a fight.And the same is true for Chinese arts.",他尽管这么想保护我，但他出去打架未必打得过别人。
So what was Chinese arts like after the Song and Yuan dynasties?,那么中国的艺术在宋元以后，它到底是怎么一个状况？
Let's compare this two sets of paintings.,我们有两组图片可以对比一下。
"This painting is The Three Graces by Raffael Santi, one of the three distinguished men of art during the Renaissance. He enjoys a great reputation in the art history.",这位呢叫拉菲尔，是文艺复兴的美术三杰之一，在美术史上是鼎鼎大名，他画的那个叫《美惠三女神》。
Now we are seeing a series of female-themed paintings by top-level western artists from the Renaissance to the modern times. All female subject.,我们现在展示的是一系列，从文艺复兴到当代，西方顶级艺术家画的女性题材。
"This is one from Renoir, a master of Impressionism in the 19th century.",十九世纪的印象派的大师雷诺阿。
And here's one from Matisse of the 20th century.,这个是二十世纪初马蒂斯。
"Quite similar to The Three Graces, right?",你看他和那个《美惠三女神》很像，对吧？
They have the same composition but totally opposite styles.,也是这个构图，但是形式又完全截然相反。
Picasso.,毕加索。
He once said that he wanted to become a worm so that he could get into Matisse's head and see what he was thinking.,毕加索曾经说过一句话，他说我想变成一个虫子，钻到马蒂斯的脑袋里，想看他是怎么想的。
"You must know this one, by Andy Warhol.",然后这个大家都应该知道，Andy Warhol。
"The painting is now on display at the Power Station of Art, and you may pay a visit if you are interested.",现在正在上海当代艺术博物馆展出，有空的可以去看看。
Those are some female sujects in paintings of some representative western artists from the Renaissance.,这是从文艺复兴到现在，我们选几个有代表性的西方艺术家，他们画的女性。
Now let's see how Chinese artists portrayed females from the Yuan Dynasty till now.,然后我们再看从元代开始到现在，中国的画家他们怎么画女性的。
Yuan Dynasty.,元代。
Zhang Ling of the Ming Dynasty.,明代，张灵。
You may not know this artist.,这个可能大家不熟悉。
He is in fact very famous and prominent in the art history.,但非常有名，其实在美术史上很有地位。
"You know this one, Tang Yin.",这一位大家都知道，唐伯虎。
This is the most famous and best-selling beauty painter in the Qing Dynasty.,这是清朝的时候，最著名的、卖得最好的仕女画家。
And this is Zhang Daqian.,这位，张大千。
"Well then, if I put those paintings together, unless you are a professional, otherwise I assume it is difficult for you to identify the painter of each one.",那么就这样，你看，如果不是很专业的人士，我把这几位放在一起，我估计大家，说这是谁画的，我看这很难。
"But with the first set of paintings, of which the painter all themed at women in different time starting from the Renaissance, are easy to distinguish, whether for amateurs or professionals.",但是你说前面，从文艺复兴到现在的西方的艺术家，他同样画的女性题材，大家一目了然，不管懂和不懂的人。
"So, why is that?",这是怎么会这样的？
"As I see it, it is quite interesting that the style and implications of Chinese paintings seem to stagnate after the Song and Yuan Dynasty.",我就觉得，中国啊很有意思，它的绘画从形式到内涵，宋元以后好像全部都完成了。
"And the painters since Song and Yuan, whether themed in landscapes, birds and flowers or figures, conformed to the pattern of this period in terms of the form, the implication and the style.",以后的历朝历代的画家，不管是画山水、花鸟、人物，没有脱离过它定下来的，从形式到内涵，到格调，都是这一老套的。
"However, in the western world, every new movement since Renaissance was based on the challenge to the former pattern and breakthroughs.",而西方从文艺复兴开始，每一个流派的诞生，它都是对前面的质疑、突破。
It followed closely the trend of world civilization and drive it forward conversely.,每一次它都和世界文明的潮流，紧紧地绑在一起，它引领着潮流的进步。
But we had our time.,我们也曾经有过很辉煌的时候。
"There is no need of getting disappointed just yet, I have to remind you that we did have our glorious days.",我说了这个我们先不要太沮丧，我们看看我们曾经有过的辉煌。
This is a western portrait of the Middle Ages.,在中世纪的时候。
Isn't this dull?,这个时候他们就画这么傻的画？
"But before this, Chinese people were creating paintings like this.",就在他们还在画这么傻的画之前哪，中国人已经在画这样的画。
So imaginative!,那么有想象力！
It's the Picture of The Ode of the River Goddess.,《洛神赋》。
"Here's a copy version of the Song Dynasty, for the original had been lost.",这幅画是宋朝的时候临摹的，摹本，它的原著已经没有了。
And this is only a part of the long scroll.,这只是那幅长卷的一部分。
"If you see the entire scroll, you will be amazed at its fertile imagination and you would take it for an American science fiction movies.",如果你们看了整个长卷，你都会觉得这是美国人拍的科幻大片，非常具有想象力的一幅画。
Another well-known one from the Tang Dynasty.,然后，唐朝的，也是那个非常著名的作品。
This a part of Han Banquet Map from the Five Dynasties.,五代的时候，也是一个局部，《韩熙载夜宴图》。
Chinese had already managed to create paintings of such high quality when the works of westerners were still dull.,那时候已经画得这么好了，而西方人画得这么傻的那个时候。
How come?,为什么？
I think we must have lost something that the Chinese arts came to a halt.,我觉得我们缺了什么东西，为什么会突然就停止下来了。
"Owing to this, painters since the Yuan Dynasty only followed established concepts and patterns.",就从元朝以后我觉得，后面的画家就不断地在重复前面的历朝历代我们定下来的概念和程式。
Our host just said that he had a definition of art.,刚才主持人说了，他把艺术有了个定义。
"Personally I think that, from the ancient times till now, the definition of art is changing continuously.",那我觉得艺术啊，从古到今，它的定义其实是在不断地改变。
There is no need of settling down on one fixed definition.,我们不要给它一个定义。
"The development in human civilization in every dynasty and historical period would infuse art with some new elements, thus a new definition.",它历朝历代每一个时间，从人类的文明的进展，它会给艺术新的定义。
"However, there has not been any new understanding of art since the Yuan dynasty in China.",而我们中国从元朝开始以后，就没有新的定义。
"Some Chinese painters argued indignantly that it's because western paintings sell far more expensive than Chinese paintings do, and that once China become more developed and rich than western countries, our paintings will be worth a lot more.",有一些画家愤愤不平说，中国的画家卖得便宜，西方的艺术画卖得这么贵，他说有朝一日我们中国发达了，我们钱比西方多，我们的画一定卖得更贵。
But is the price the only reason why some artistic works are valuable?,难道仅仅是因为卖得贵，这个艺术才有价值吗？
You must be familiar with this one.,这幅画大家都熟悉。
"At the end of the world, only a few humans can get the tickets to the Noal's Ark, but this painting will definitely get on board.",2012的时候，人类只有极少部分能上方舟，这幅画要上去。
Do you know why?,为什么？
What is Mona Lisa to the westerners?,它在西方，人们的心目中它到底是什么地位?
Is it because of the fantastic painting skills that they value it so much?,难道仅仅是因为画得好？
Or is it because of her mysterious look?,蒙娜丽莎的眼神那么神秘？
There is more than that.,不仅仅是如此。
"Personally, I think that the western world today would not be the same if there had not been this painting.",我可以说如果没有这张画，就没有西方的今天。
Renaissance actually served as a crowbar in forcing open the iron curtain in the Middle Ages.,文艺复兴，它是把中世纪黑暗的铁幕，撬开了一道缝。
Our host was right.,刚才主持人说得非常好。
Do you have desires?,大家有欲望吗？
I believe all people do.,人都有欲望。
"Nevertheless, during the entire European history, from the Middle Ages to the 5th century then the end of 14th century, people had to refrain from their desires.",但是中世纪从公元五世纪到十五世纪之前，整个一段历史在欧洲，人类的欲望是被禁锢的。
"Europeans were not allow to express any natural desires, whether sexual or material.",不允许表达你的欲望，不管是性欲还是物质的欲望。
"From then on, some painters started to furtively express their desires through paintbrushes.",而从那个时候开始，有几个画家，他们就把画笔开始偷偷地表达人类的欲望。
"For example, Raffaello portrayed gods as beauties when gods were the only permissible subject of paintings.",比如说当时你只能画神的题材，诶拉菲尔就把神画得更像美女。
It is recorded in the art history that Raffaello was a lustful painter.,美术史上说拉斐尔是一个好色的画家。
"Thanks to his ""lust"",  he humanized gods and revealed natural human desires for sex and beauty in his paintings.",非常感谢他这么好色，他就把神画的像人啦，偷偷地寄托着人对性的欲望，对美好的欲望。
"In this work of Da Vinci, what he painted was just the wife of his neighbour's, an ordinary person.",而达芬奇这幅画呢，它只是画了一个隔壁邻居的妻子，是一个普通的平民。
"But, for a painting like this, with this kind of composition, what was its impact back then?",但是，要知道这样的一幅画，这种格局啊，在当时是意味着什么？
Let's think about Chairman Mao's statue during the Great Cultural Revolution in China.,我们想想文化大革命，或者想想那个毛主席像。
"At that time, the statue stood for dignity and status.",这个像，这种格局，这就是一个尊严，一个地位。
"Likewise, at that time, paintings were meant for figures like Virgin Mary, royals like queens, popes, aristocracies or gods.",而那个时候，这样的像要么画圣母玛利亚，要么画王后，要么画教皇，就是画皇宫贵族，和神像。
"However, he applied his excellent painting skills to present an ordinary person, just to make it more vivid and real.",他是用他发明的最高妙的绘画技术，就是要画得最像人，这种技术画了一个平民。
From this I grasp two meanings.,这有两层概念。
"First, why?",为什么？
He wanted them to stay close to the people.,他要贴近人。
"Second, he made painting equal to all human beings.",第二，把画的等级给放到平等的地位。
"He showed us with his brushes that hether you are a king, a pope or an ordinary people, we are all equal before God.",不管你是国王、教皇还是平民，在神的面前我们都是平等的人，他用画笔来说明了这个道理。
"The two meanings contributed to the fundamental concepts of Renaissance: humanism, equality and liberation of humanity.",那么文艺复兴，它的理念就开始出来了：人文主义精神，平等、个性解放。
"So, starting from these artists, the iron curtain was finally cracked open.",就从这些艺术家开始，他们把那个铁幕撬开了。
"During the decades after that, people there have been constantly practicing this belif during every artistic breakthrough and movement.",然后从此以后的几百年，西方的每一次艺术的大的突破，每一次艺术潮流，他们都在不断地要实践这个理念。
"They advocated that lifes were equal, that everyone had the right to express oneself and to challenge conventional art laws and standards.",就是我们是平等的，每个人都有权利主张自己的个性，每个人都有权利质疑前面的权威的艺术、定理。
"Why do I have to do this, and why can't I do that?",为什么我要这样，我为什么不可以这样？
Now let's see this portrait.,我们来看看这幅画。
Actually I was quite familiar with it before I could see it at the Amsterdam Museum in the Netherlands two years ago.,前两年我在那个荷兰阿姆斯特丹博物馆，其实过去都很熟悉这幅画了。
"But after I heard the story behind from a researcher there, it struck me that all men of art and people who appreciated and understood art in China should also know the story.",但是我听他们的研究员跟我讲了故事以后，我就另外的想法，我觉得中国所有从事艺术的人，和我们欣赏艺术的人，理解艺术，都要理解这幅画的故事。
Rembrandt was the most famous and best-selling artist of that time in the Netherlands.,伦勃朗在当时的荷兰，是最著名的艺术家，和卖得最好的艺术家。
And he could portrayed humans extremely pretty and absolutely lifelike.,也是画得最漂亮，他最能把人惟妙惟肖地画出来的艺术家。
"However, his misfortune started because of this painting.",但是，他从这幅画开始倒霉了。
Why?,为什么呢？
A great many wealthy man commissioned him to paint then.,当时呢有很多有钱人都要委托他画画。
"There were some elites, offsprings of the powerful and the wealthy who served as the civic militia guards against pirates. They asked him to paint a group portrait for them.",然后就有一群有钱人，他们要说，你帮我们画这样一幅群体像，然后他们这些有钱人呢都组成一个巡逻队，巡城的，因为当时有海盗，都是官二代和富二代。
"They asked that all people in a group portrait should be in one row, just like how the seven members of the standing committee came out after the 18th National Congress of the CPC in China, there should be no difference in terms of their position in the picture.",然后呢这些人呢，按照当时的规定是怎么样，如果你要画一个群体的像，必须啊，就像我们开完十八大，七常委出来一样，一个一个都大家都得站在一个线上，你不可以有大有小有前有后的。
"However, Rembrandt didn't follow this rule.",这个伦勃朗就违背这个规律了。
He invented.,他就异想天开。
"He gave the portrait a story and made it the context of the story, with foregrounds and backgrounds, fluctuations of light and dark and even his wife in it.",就想把它画成一个故事情节，画成一个场景，有虚有实有前有后，甚至他把他老婆都偷偷画到里面去了。
"His clients were angry with the portrait at the sight of it, saying that Rembrandt must have taken bribes from the people who were in a better position on the painting. So they sued him.",这一幅画出来，别人不干了，别人就告了他，说他受了贿，说他一定拿了这个前面的人钱多了，你把他画到前面，后面我没贿赂你，你就把我画到后面。
And Rembrandt actually lost the lawsuit.,结果这一个告啊，伦勃朗还真败了。
He went bankrupt for the lawsuit and even did some time.,败了以后就倾家荡产，甚至还坐牢。
He could not pay his taxes because no one aked him to paint.,他拿不出钱来付税，没有人找他画画。
"Then after a few years, he got his last opportunity.",就在这个时候，过了几年，他有一次唯一的机会来了。
"The town hall needed a big portrait of the founder of the Netherlands, just like the Founding Ceremony in China.",市政厅需要一幅大的画，画开国元勋的，就像《开国大典》那样。
"But no one could handle such a big portrait, so they thought about Rembrandt.",这种画，说没有别的画家能画这么大的画，说让伦勃朗来画吧。
Some hestitated and said that Rembrandt did not play by the book and hardly followed any instruction.,他们讨论说不行啊，伦勃朗这个人乱画的，你叫他画，他不听话。
Others thought that Rembrandt was too broke to ruin this opportunity.,他说不会吧，这个人都已经落魄潦倒了，唯一的机会啊。
"Finally, they decided on Rembrandt.",画吧，叫他。
Then Rembrandt started to paint.,好，伦勃朗就把这画就画好。
They told him to paint it exactly as the way he was told.,好好画，不能乱画。
He agreed.,哦。
"On the opening day of the town hall, when the curtain fell, people saw the portrait and were all astonished.",等到市政厅开幕的时候，大幕拉下，这幅画出现了，大家惊呆了。
On the painting were the founder of the Netherlands plotting a rebellion with a gang of bandits.,他画的是谁，荷兰的开国元勋，和一群土匪在一起商量明天我们怎么造反。
"By the way, the founder of Netherlands was not so handsome as our Chairman Mao was, he had only one eye.",而那个开国元勋长得就没我们毛主席这么漂亮，这么帅，一个眼睛还独眼龙。
So he was always portrayed in profile and never in front by other painters.,所以过去所有人画他都是画单面的，不画正面。
"For example, if I had something on one cheek, I would only allow the painter to paint a profile painting to hide it.",就像我今天这里发了个东西，我要这样转过来，就画这里不能画那边。
"Rembrandt painted his one eye on purpose and he was with a group of bandits, they looked all dishevelled and ugly.",结果伦勃朗还偏把他那个独眼龙给画出来了，而且和他一群的那些土匪在一起，都衣冠不整啊那样子都很难看的，就画出来。
"Actually, Rembrandt knew what he was doing.",其实伦勃朗有自己的想法。
He thought that was how the Netherlands was built.,我们荷兰国家就是这样建国的，我们就是这样打出的江山。
So why should people deny this fact?,到了今天，有什么可以回避的呢？为什么不要正视这个现实呢？
"As a result, he never got another chance in his remaining years and died in poverty.",结果，从此一蹶不振，伦勃朗，落魄潦倒而死。
"However, he still stuck to his ideas and painting style.",但他一直还是坚持自己的这样的原则，这样的画风。
"In the later period, he gradually changed his style.",他到后来自己画风也改变了。
"His paintings, which had been delicate, became so rough that others deemed them incomplete.",他本来画得很精细，他画得很粗犷，别人都说你的画没完成。
"He actually inspired the impressionists, we could find his trace in impressionist paintings, why is that?",后来的印象派的绘画，就是从他开始，印象派的绘画从他那里能找到影子了，为什么？
No painters at that time would claim painting for themselves since they had to paint on commissions.,当时啊没有艺术家是说我为自己画画，都是要为别人画画。
Rembrandt was the first to paint for himself.,伦勃朗开始我要为自己画画。
"Through the brushwork and colors, he wanted to express his feelings.",我的笔触，我的色彩，要表达自己的情感。
"When admiring his paintings, you could relate to his emotions and rhythms in the process of creating.",你能从他的画中间，你能看到那个绘画者当时他的情绪，他的节奏。
All the painters I mentioned were ancient westerners.,那么，这些画家都已经是在西方，历朝历代已经过去很久的画家了。
"In the following hundreds of years, painters constantly push art forward.",后来有很多画家把艺术推进了又推进。
Some even became the hinder for the subsequent painters.,甚至那些画家后来都已经成为后面画家的障碍啦。
The ideas they put up became authority and were then abandoned by the younger generations of artists.,他们真树立的理念后来又成为权威，后面又有新的画家把他们的理念给推翻。
"Well, who dared to challenge tradition from the Yuan Dynasty till now in China?",而我们，从元朝开始到现在，谁敢质疑传统？
The painting style has never been changed ever since.,历朝历代都这么画，画到今天还这么画。
"It seems that, at present, some Chinese painters abandoned the old way and starts to make innovations, the so-called modern art.",好像今天有一些画家不这么画了，啊他们有所谓的当代艺术，有创新。
"But if you have some knowledge of the modern western art and the western art history, you will find it interesting that almost all oil paintings of Chinese author were copying previous works of western painters.",但是你们稍微了解多一点西方的当代艺术，了解一下西方的美术史，你会发现很有意思，中国几乎所有的油画家，他画的画，都是抄袭的，都是山寨的，都是前面那些人，西方人画过。
"If what Chinese artists do were imitating the paintings of ancient Chinese or western artists, then where is our own art?",那么我们就变成要么是画中国古人画过的画，要么是画西方人画过的画，我们的艺术在哪里？
"If what Chinese artists could do is to drive up the prices on the art market instead of pushing forward the advance of human and national civilization, openning up our mind, stimulating our imagination and our creativity, if not so, could what they do be called ""art""?",如果我们中国的艺术家，只能创造一个艺术市场的天价，却不能推动人类的文明进步，推动国家的文明进步，也不能开拓我们的胸襟，激发我们的想象力、创造力，这样的艺术是艺术吗？
I would rather call that craftsmanship.,这样的艺术是工艺。
"In other words, I think that in China, the craftsmanship has replaced the value of art since Yuan.",我可以说从元至后，中国有工艺这个内涵替代了艺术。
"In disguise of art, it created craft works.",它假借着艺术的外壳，其实是做的工艺的事情。
So that is why I said there was no arts after the Song and Yuan dynasties.,所以我说宋元以后没有艺术。
I feel reluctant to say so.,但这样说其实心里很不愿意。
"I do hope that Chinese artists, appraisers and art enthusiasts would start from now to make efforts in pushing Chinese arts forward and restore its original nature.",我真的希望从现在开始，我们的艺术家和我们所有的鉴赏家，我们所有的艺术热爱者，一起来推动中国的艺术，让它回归艺术。
Thank You!,谢谢大家！
"Hi, everyone!",啊，大家好！
"I am very happy to be here today and I feel much honored to have this opportunity to talk to you about ""science and beauty"".",呃今天非常高兴，非常荣幸有机会来和大家分享一下“美与科学”。
"It does not mean the science of beautiful women, although it does involve a discussion on beauty.",不是美女科学啊，啊当然我们要讲美女。
"After all, the science of beauty would not be truly scientific if it fails to explain the beauty of women, so we have to get it right.",呃不能够应用到美女的美学都是伪哲学，所以我们要把这件事情搞对。
"So today, I would like to share two things with you: the first is the science of beauty, which is the science inside the beauty; the second point is the beauty of science.",所以我今天的话呢给大家分享两个部分：第一部分是美的科学，就是美里面的科学；第二部分讲科学的美，科学里面的美。
To me November 25th is the day of greatest beauty.,11月25号对我来讲是最美的日子。
Why?,为什么美？
There are two reasons.,两个原因。
"The first reason is that a hundred years ago, on this very day, Einstein published his theory of general relativity, which is the most beautiful science theory to me.",一个原因是一百年前在这个日子，爱因斯坦发表了广义相对论理论，所以对我来讲是最美的科学理论。
"Another reason is , as you can see, 25 years ago, my daughter, the most beautiful girl in the world was born.",另外一个原因大家也看到了，25年前世界上最美的女孩儿诞生了，我的女儿。
What is the commonality between the beauty of my daughter and the beauty of the theory of general relativity?,我的女儿的美和广义相对论的美之间有什么共性？
What is scientific about them?,这里面有什么科学规律？
This is the first point I want to make today.,这是我今天要和大家分享的。
"In other words, the question we are asking is what is beauty?",换句话说，我们要问一个问题：美是什么？
"This is a question that has been pursued by philosophers for more than two thousand years, from the great philosopher Socrates to his student Plato, and Plato's student Aristotle, on to  Kant and Hegel, etc.",那么这个问题事实上哲学家已经问了两千多年了，从大哲学家苏格拉底开始到他的学生柏拉图，柏拉图的学生亚里士多德，到现在的康德、黑格尔等等哲学家都问过这个问题。
It is called the Geniuses' Doubt.,这个问题被称作为天才的追问。
So let's see what the modern answer to this millennium-old question is.,那么我们看看哲学家们问了两千多年之后，现在的答案是什么。
"Of course, there exist multiple answers.",那么当然答案种类非常的多。
Let's take the answer by aesthetics experts summarized by Professor Zhu Liyuan of Fudan University as an example.,我们选一下复旦大学朱立元教授所总结的美学家对这个问题的看法。
"Professor Zhu thought that he finds it hard to give a personal answer, but as Plato has said : What's Beautiful is Difficult, he would think the same .",朱教授说我自己觉得还没有办法回答这个问题，但是柏拉图说过，美是难的，因此美是难的。
"Moreover, Professor Zhu added that he felt that this saying is words of wisdom.",而且朱教授接着说我觉得这真是千真万确的至理名言。
What's Beautiful is indeed Difficult.,美是什么，美是难的。
"Personally, I would like to say that What's Beautiful is Female.",我倒想说美是女的。
"Suppose we are in a classroom, when I was lecturing, Xiao'an or An Xiaoxue, one of the audience today,  asked one question, “Dear professor, how high is the sun?”",假如说我们在课堂上，那么我讲课的时候，呃安同学，比如说我们今天的安小雪同学，那么提问，问我说：“尊敬的教授，请问太阳有多高？”
"Since I am a professor of astronomy, this is considered an appropriate question.",那我是教天文学的，问这个问题还是对的。
"I would reply: ""My dear, how real am I!""",我回答说：“亲爱的同学，我有多真啊！”
"Xiao'an goes on to ask, ""How many stars are there up in the sky?""",再接着问：“请问天上有多少星星？”
"Again, I would reply: ""There are millions and millions of them"".",我再接着回答：“有N多N多”。
This situation may remind you of a song by a beautiful singer Yang Yuying telling a similar story.,大家可以想起来了，我们有一个美女杨钰莹唱过一首歌非常类似的。
"If I keep answering her questions in this manner, Xiao'an will definitely feel very frustrated.",那么如果我以同样的方式回答问题，我想安同学出去肯定就要哭晕在厕所里了。
These are some typical examples of irrelevant answers.,所以这就是典型的答非所问。
"In my opinion, ""What's Beautiful is Difficult"" is an example of irrelevant answers.",在我看来美是什么，回答美是难的，有点像这种答非所问。
What is Beauty?,因此，美是什么？
"""What's Beautiful is Difficult""",美是难的。
"I am not sure how you perceive this pair of question and answer, but I myself find it problematic.",至于你们怎么看，反正我是不信。
Why?,为什么？
Because this is not scientific.,因为这不科学。
In what way?,为什么不科学？
Avoiding the question is not our way.,答非所问不是我们的习惯。
"As scientists, we find out the underlying cause of it and we answer it right to the point.",刨根问底是科学家的天职，我们要回答这个问题。
"Therefore, what do I think of this question?",那么我怎么来想这个问题？
"In fact, I have been thinking about it for nearly 30 years.",其实我想了差不多30年。
I want to do aesthetics in a scientific way.,我需要用自然科学的方法来研究美学。
"The famous physicist, Mr. Peng Hengwu, once said, “Although the physical world is ever changing, it is very sincere. The same phenomena will always occur under the same conditions.”",我们有一个著名的物理学家——彭桓武先生，他讲过一句话，他说：“物质世界虽然千变万化，但是却十分得真诚，‘在同样条件下必然出现同样的现象’。”
I believe the same goes for aesthetics.,那么我把彭先生的这句话应用到美学的研究上面。
"I believe that although the world of beauty is ever changing, for example, we have beauty of all kinds present today; it is by no means without any rule.",我想说的是美的世界虽然千变万化，虽然在场有各种各样的美女都非常的不同，但是应该有内在的规律。
"Then, if I were to answer the question, I will start with the question itself first.",那么我具体做起来的话呢，我就首先要从问题来着手。
"Einstein not only taught us what general relativity is, but also the scientific way to do research.",爱因斯坦老师教导我们说，不仅仅是爱因斯坦教我们了广义相对论，同时也教我们了科学研究方法。
He said that coming up with a good question is far more meaningful than solving several problems.,他说提出一个好问题比解决N个问题都要重要。
So what is beauty?,美是什么？
I think this question needs to be reworded.,这个问题我觉得可以换一个提法。
"I think it can be reworded as what makes an aesthetic object, which may refer to human, scenery, cuisine, art and science, beautiful to us?",我的这个提法就是说广义的审美对象，可以包括美人、可以包括美景、可以包括美食、或者美术，美的艺术、诶可以包括美的科学，它们满足什么样的标准，我们作为审美者审美的主体觉得美？
"In other words, what is the criterion of beauty in a general sense?",换句话说广义美的判断标准是什么？
This question is rephrased.,我把这个问题转化了。
"In this was, if the criterion of beauty in a general sense can be established, then we would be able to understand ""what is beauty"" or ""the essence of beauty.""",换句话说广义美的判断标准如果确立了，我们就能够理解“什么是美”了或者“美是什么”了。
"Of course, a more academic way to put ""the criterion of beauty in a general sense"" would be, in my words, ""the law of beauty in a general sense"", as I intend to establish a law of beauty in a general sense.",当然广义美的判断标准学术化一点我把它叫做广义美的法则，所以我是想建立一个广义美的法则。
So what are the specific steps?,那么具体的做法的话呢？
"I adopt syllogism, the default practice in natural science research.",我是遵从我们自然科学研究的比较标准的一个三段式的方法。
"As for the research procedures, there are three specific stages.",研究步骤的话呢我们具体来讲我们是三段式的方法。
"First, we induce.",首先我们要归纳。
We compare different types of beauty and find out what is common among them.,我们要根据我们把不同类型的美都拿出来，我们总结共性得到美的法则。
Then we testify.,然后我们要证实。
"That is to say, we accumulate more examples, and examine as many examples as possible to testify the reliability of the common law we have established.",也就是说再举出更多的例子，尽可能穷举看看有没有我们认为美的事情违反我们的法则。
"If some examples are against this law, we need to adjust it accordingly.",如果不，如违反了我们要修改这个法则。
"Next, we falsify.",然后我们还要证伪。
"We try to find out a counterexample, something that is beautiful but is against this common law.",我们要找出不符合这种法则的我们又觉得美的事情来找反例。
"In this way, I arrived at the law of beauty in the general sense.",这样的话呢，我就最终我得到了广义美的法则。
"The law can be defined as ""flawless and uncommon.""",这个广义美的法则就是“没缺陷、不常见”。
Objects with these two qualities are thought to be beautiful.,满足这两个条件我们就会觉得美。
“Flawless” refers to its value.,“没缺陷”针对的是价值观。
"Qualities such as being powerful, natural, reasonable, intact, authentic and kind.",比如说功能强大，比如说很自然、很合理、完整、真、善。
"""Uncommon"" refers to properties such as being peculiar, exotic, excellent and posh while “common"" refers to qualities such as being unsophisticated, raw, fake and so on.",诶常见，当然“不常见”指的比如说别样、不一样、出色呀、洋气呀等等，也可以是很常见的比如说很土气呀、市侩呀、模仿啊、山寨呀等等。
"Gentlemen, I strongly suggest you avoiding these ""common"" items on my list when depicting your girlfriend or wife, you might get killed or strangled for this.",在座的男士你如果把我这个列的“常见”的任何一条贴到你的女朋友或者你太太的身上我保证她不打死你也会掐死你。
"Therefore, the key to judge what is beauty lies in this.",所以美不美的判断就在这个地方。
What is aesthetic quotient?,什么是审美观？
Why do we develop divergent aesthetics quotients?,为什么我们会有不同的审美观？
"Aesthetics quotient is the ability to judge beauty, to determine whether an object is flawless on a value level and whether it is uncommon through our experience.",审美观就是判断美的能力，价值观来判断是否有缺陷，然后我们的见识来判断是否不常见。
"Therefore, differences in our values and experiences lead to divergent aesthetics orientations.",因此不同的价值观加上我们不同的见识就导致了我们有不同的审美观，
Those who find a object or person flawless and uncommon will see beauty in it.,对同样的事情、物体、人，谁认为不没缺陷不常见谁就觉得美。
You experience beauty when you find something flawless and uncommon.,你什么时候觉得没缺陷不常见你就什么时候觉得美。
Beauty vanishes when you begin to feel the opposite.,你什么时候觉得常见了你觉得平常了你就不觉得美了。
"Therefore, there is no beauty, which is objective, universally applicable and eternal.",因此没有客观的美，没有绝对的美，没有普世的美，也没有永恒的美。
Beauty is ever changing.,美永远是在变化着的。
Here is another example.,我下面给大家举一个例子。
These are some pictures that I posted on my WeChat Moments yesterday.,这是昨天我在我朋友圈里面贴的一个东西。
"As we all know, the sky in Beijing has been very clear for the past few days.",我们知道前几天北京天气很好。
Many have posted pictures of blue sky and white clouds.,大家都纷纷地在自己朋友圈里面贴蓝天白云。
Yesterday I posted several pictures of the morning glow and the white clouds.,我昨天贴了早晨的朝霞和白云。
"And I commented ""Why bright as the morning glow, clear as the blue sky, fewer will be amazed by this scenery again?""",我说：“朝霞还是辣么灿烂，蓝天还是飘着白云，但是为什么今天没有人说美了呢？”
"This is because the blue sky and white clouds have been the norm for a while, although they are still flawless, they are no longer uncommon anymore, so people cease to find them beautiful.",因为已经蓝天白云一段时间了，尽管还是没缺陷，但是不再不常见了，所以大家不觉得美了。
"Therefore, I went to say, ""Smog! Tell me gently when will you come back from your vacation?""",所以我说：“雾霾啊！轻轻地告诉我你什么时候结束休假？”
I asked such a question.,我问了这么一个问题。
"One of my friends commented jokingly: ""If your post were seen by a scientist, you might be misunderstood as verifying your aesthetic theory at the cost of the health of the general public.""",然后有一个评论，一位朋友说：“科学哲学家万一看到了这个，肯定要拔高到说科学家为了验证他的美学理论，要来牺牲大家的健康”。
I quickly replied that I did not mean it that way.,我赶紧回答说我说不是这么回事儿。
"I added, desperate to get my point across, that I prefer the ""not so uncommon"" blue sky and I would never want anyone to suffer from smog issues.",我回答说我说我屁滚尿流惊慌失措地回答，宁愿要常见的蓝天的常见也不要健康的缺陷。
Another friend's comment is even more surprising.,然后又有一个朋友接着评论说，这个评论更绝。
"He said, ""The smog has been away for quite a few days, I miss it already. So how is the weather today?""",他说：“几天不见我雾霾还挺想念的，今天的天气怎么样？”
"So that is what happens when you keep a ""bad"" companion.",所以交友不慎就是这个后果。
And here is a further example.,再举一个例子。
"This example is about Prof. He Zehui, my mentor.",这个例子是何泽慧先生，她是我的导师。
"Together with the autumn scenery in Tsinghua Park, she stands as the epitome of beauty to me.",和清华园的秋色美景，我说也是都是美的极致。
This is what I posted on my WeChat Moments on November 22nd.,这是我在11月22号贴在我的朋友圈里面的。
Two events happened on that day.,11月22号那天发生了两件事情。
The first was a meeting at Tsinghua University in commemoration of the 69th anniversary of the publication of Prof. He Zehui's outstanding research work.,一件事情是在清华大学举行了一场纪念会，是纪念我的导师何泽慧先生重要的研究成果发表69周年，
But Prof. He passed away a few years ago.,但何先生几年前去世了。
Please look at this photo on the left side of the screen. The little girl in it was Prof.,我们看看这张照片里面的，左边这个小女孩儿是个小美女。
He in her younger years.,是何先生年轻时候时候的照片。
Obviously a real beauty.,显然是个小美女。
On the right side is a picture of her in the later years.,右边是我的导师何先生晚年时候的照片。
We can see she was still glorious.,依然是光彩照人。
"Therefore, to me Prof. He is the epitome of brilliance, beauty and morality.",所以我说何先生是高智商、高颜值、高品德的极致。
Such a beauty is the ultimate beauty.,这样的美女就是美的极致。
The autumn scenery in Tsinghua Park is breath-taking and flawless; it is right in its prime.,同样清华园的秋色美景，秋色是好的没有缺陷，因为丰收的季节嘛。
And this kind of beauty usually resides in a natural environment.,当然也要看到秋色通常要有比较好的自然的环境。
"The snow scene is beautiful, especially the first snow.",雪景也是好的，每年的第一场雪瑞雪兆丰年也是好的。
"On that very day, Beijing had a heavy snowfall.",11月20号那天北京下了一场大雪。
These two events are both flawless.,但是这两件事情放在一起，当然仍然是没有缺陷。
"What's more, they rarely happen together.",但更重要的是不常见。
The autumn scenery and snow scenes are rarely seen together.,秋色雪景在一起不常见。
The snow will melt in warmer days and the autumn scenery may be over if the snow comes too late.,雪下得早了化掉了留不下雪景，雪下得晚了秋色没有了。
The snow scenes together with the autumn scenery are of the most beauty.,秋色雪景放在一起是最美的。
This is an extreme example of being flawless and uncommon.,因为是没缺陷，不常见的极端。
"So on that day, everyone was busy posting photos on WeChat Moments.",所以11月20那天，大家都在网上，都在朋友圈里面贴照片。
This is the reason.,原因就是这个。
"Likewise, a beauty of brilliance, beauty and morality is extremely rare , and so is extremely beautiful.",而具有三高的美女也是极为罕见的，所以是美的极致。
My example has suggested that what's beautiful is flawless and uncommon.,我举例子说明没缺陷、不常见是最美的。
"Next, let's move to the beauty of science.",下面讲科学之美。
We already clarified on the science of beauty.,前面讲了美的科学讲清楚了。
Let's go on to talk about the beauty of science.,下面讲科学之美。
"As we know it, science investigation is full of surprises.",科学探索我们知道，充满了意外。
Being unexpected is being uncommon.,意外当然就是最大的不常见。
I do astronomy.,那么我自己做天文学研究的。
Take astronomy as an example.,我用天文学作为例子。
We know that most groundbreaking studies in astronomy are accidental and unintended.,我们知道大部分的开创性的天文学的研究都是意外之作。
I did a rough counting.,我统计了一下。
"Of a dozen or more Physics Nobel Prize winners in Astronomy institutes, only one wins because of the intended research results; the rest of them win by unexpected results.",天文学研究所获得了大概十几个诺贝尔物理学奖，只有一个是按照计划取得了成果，获得诺贝尔奖，其他的一律是意外之作，意都是意外之作。
"Given the time limits, I will just give another example though there are plenty of them.",当然限于时间我只讲其中的一个例子，我虽然罗列了这么多我只讲一个。
This story also related to a beauty.,啊这个也跟美女有关系。
"In 1967, Madam Bell discovered the radio pulsar.",这就是1967年贝尔女士发现了射电脉冲星。
Look at this young girl; this is Madam Bell as a graduate student.,我们先看看这个小美女，啊她这是她研究时候的照片，研究生时候的照片。
"At that time, she was studying interstellar scintillation, a phenomenon already known.",哎她那个时候要做的就是要来研究星际闪烁现象，那时候已经知道有这个现象了。
"But by accident she discovered the radio pulsar, periodic radio signals.",但是她意外地发现了射电脉冲星，就是周期性到达的射电信号。
The photo on the far right was taken this summer in Hawaii. I met Prof.,那在最右边这个照片是今年夏天去年夏天在夏威夷我开会遇到贝尔教授。
Bell there who had been an old acquaintance.,那以前我也认识她。
We chatted for a while.,我们在一起聊了聊天。
We can see from the photo she is still stunning.,我们看到贝尔教授依然是光彩照人。
"She is another representation of brilliance, beauty and morality.",所以这也是高颜值、高智商、高品德的三高美女。
This kind of women deserves our respect and admiration.,这一类的三高美女，统统是我的女神。
Here are a few more photos that we may consider beautiful.,下面再给大家看几个照片，呃大家认为的美景的照片。
"Left is a photo from biology, depicting the Sclerotinia sclerotiorum spores.",最左边的这个照片是生物的照片，核盘菌孢子爆发的一个照片。
In the middle is a photo of a finger poking the soap bubbles.,然后中间这个是我们手指头捅破一个肥皂泡的一个照片。
At the far right is a photo of a galaxy.,最右边是一个星系的照片。
These photos are thought as beautiful.,这些照片都是美得不要不要的照片。
Why?,为什么美？
The phenomena are natural so they are flawless; they cannot be seen with the naked eye so they are uncommon.,现象很自然所以没缺陷，肉眼看不到所以不常见。
"These phenomena happen a lot, but they are invisible to us, so we are amazed at the sight of them.",它经常发生，但是我们的眼睛没看到，所以我们看到了之后就说这是美得不要不要的照片。
"Again, this explains my point.",再一次说明这个问题。
These photos of science phenomena are no exception.,科学的照片也是这样。
Let us move to Einstein's general theory of relativity.,下面讲爱因斯坦广义相对论。
"I mentioned earlier a hundred years ago on November 25th Einstein published the theory of general relativity, the most beautiful scientific theory ever.",我们知道啊我刚才讲了一百年前的11月25号，最美的科学理论广义相对论被爱因斯坦发表了。
General relativity builds on Newtonian mechanics; Newton published his theory in 1687.,广义相对论当然是建立在牛顿力学的基础之上的，牛顿的力学理论我们知道他是在19，1687年发表的。
This theory looks simple today.,这个理论其实我们今天看起来是很简单。
"Einstein extends Galileo's Law of Inertia to Newton's First Law and Second Law and generalizes Newton's third law, which are Newton's original works, as with the universal gravitation.",他是把伽利略的惯性原理提升成了牛顿的第一和第二定律，再加上了牛顿第三定律，这个是牛顿的原创，和万有引力定律也是牛顿的原创。
"In this way, we are able to account for Kepler's Three Laws.",然后就我们能够解释开普勒三定律。
This is the essence of his theory.,所以这是他的理论的实质性的内容。
"How is this ""flawless""?",他的“没缺陷”体现在哪儿？
Well he gave a unified account of all the known observations and experimental data at the time.,他解释了当时所有已知的观测和实验现象。
This is flawless.,当然是完全的没缺陷。
"This is ""uncommon"" because this is the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory ever.",“不常见”反映在这是人类历史上第一个定量和系统的科学理论。
He predicted the existence of Neptune and this prediction was later verified by observation.,他正确地预言了海王星的存在，正确的预言就他预言之后被观测发现了。
And the discovery of Neptune in turn established the legitimacy of Newton's theory of classic mechanics as the first natural science theory.,正是海王星的发现彻底确立了牛顿力学理论里作为第一个自然科学理论的正确性。
Newton's theory of mechanics was beautiful and flawless for his time.,所以从当时的观点来看，牛顿的力学理论已经很美，是当时的没缺陷、不常见的极致。
"However, some people do not see it that way, for example Einstein.",但是有人不这么看，这就是爱因斯坦。
Einstein believed that Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation is flawed in two aspects.,爱因斯坦认为牛顿的引力理论有缺陷，反映在两个方面。
"First, the theory is flawed.",一是理论上面是有缺陷的。
Einstein believed that the instantaneous action in Newton's theory violates the Special Theory of Relativity.,爱因斯坦认为牛顿理论里面的瞬时作用违反狭义相对论。
"Therefore, he went on to ask what is the nature of gravity?",因此他问引力的本质到底是什么？
It is flawed in its applicability.,有用性的缺陷。
Einstein examined the precession of the perihelion of Mercury in detail.,爱因斯坦深刻地考察了水星近日点的反常进动。
He believed that this could not be explained by Newton's theory of gravity.,他认为这个无法用牛顿的引力理论进行解释。
So he wondered the applicability of Newton's theory of gravitation.,所以他问牛顿引力理论的适用范围到底有多大。
These are two huge flaws for Einstein.,这对爱因斯坦来讲是两个非常大的缺陷。
"Therefore, Einstein proposed the theory of general relativity that made up for the shortcomings of Newton's theory.",因此爱因斯坦提出了广义相对论，当然弥补了完全弥补了牛顿理论的缺陷。
Einstein's theory is flawless. In this theory gravity is the consequence of the curvature of space-time caused by the uneven distribution of mass.,他理论上的没缺陷体现体现在引力的本质是质量导致时空的弯曲。
"The curved space-time determines the movement of all matter, light waves included.",弯曲的时空再决定了一切物质的运动，包括光线的运动。
This theory is flawless in its applicability. It approximates Newton's theory in the weak gravitational field and works more accurately than Newton's theory in the case of a strong gravitational field.,实用性的没缺陷体现在它在弱引力场下面近似于牛顿理论，在强引力场的情况之下比牛顿理论更加精确。
"That is to say, General relativity is comparable to Newton's theory.",因此牛顿理论所能解释的所有的现象广义相对论都能够解释。
"What's more, it can account for phenomena that cannot be explained by Newton's theory and works more accurately.",牛顿理论不能解释的现象或者不可忽略误差的地方，广义相对论也完全能够适用。
"Therefore, in this sense General Relativity is flawless at that time.",因此广义相对论在当时来讲提出的时候是没有缺陷的。
This theory also needs to be uncommon to fit our definition of the law of beauty.,那么这个理论也需要不常见才能满足没缺陷不常见的美学的广义法则。
This is another example of flawless beauty. As we have discussed it explained the essence of gravity in theory and made up for the inaccuracy of Newton's theory in applicability.,另外一个没缺陷的例子我刚才讲了它的理论上面是引力的本质。实用上面是在弥补了牛顿理论的计算不精确的地方。
A very good case is the Precession of the perihelion of Mercury.,最重要的一点就是水星近日点的反常进动。
This is completely incomprehensible by Newton's theory.,这个是牛顿理论里面完全不能理解的。
"According to General Relativity, as highlighted here the problem was neatly solved.",在广义相对论里面我给大家列出来这个地方我们可以看到广义相对论精确地计算的出来了这个结果。
This made up for a major flaw in Newton's theory.,因此弥补了牛顿理论里面的一个主要的一个缺陷。
"Moreover, General relativity is uncommon because it is the first theory that connects matter with space-time.",广义相对论不常见还体现了它是第一个把物质和时空建立了深刻联系的理论。
"So we have talked about that Newton's theory was the first quantitative and systematic scientific theory at that time, and the theory of general relativity was the first one to connect matter with space-time and the first one to reveal the curvature of space-time in the material world.",我刚才讲了牛顿理论在当时是第一个定量和系统的科学理论，而广义相对论理论是第一个把物质和时空建立了深刻联系的理论，是第一个揭示了物质世界的时空本质上是弯曲的理论。
Space-time was thought to be flat but now it is proven as curved.,以前都认为是平直的，现在认为是弯曲的。
"Moreover, this theory lead to the discovery of new types of celestial bodies and a series of new phenomena, black holes, cosmic expansion, gravitational deflection, gravitational redshift, gravitational waves, etc. included.",而且这个理论成功地预言了新类型的天体和一系列新的现象，包括黑洞、宇宙膨胀、引力偏折、引力红移、引力波等等一系列的预言。
Most of these predictions have been observed and verified.,这其中大部分都得到了观测的证认。
Others still need verification.,还剩下少量那么还等待着证实。
I will give you another simple example.,我给大家简单地举一下例子。
"About the deflection of light in the gravitational field of the Sun, a phenomenon which verified the prediction of general relativity.",这是引力偏折对验证了广义相对论的预言。
"According to General relativity, light rays of a distant celestial body will be deflected in the gravitational field of the Sun.",因为广义相对论预言遥远处的天体的光线经过太阳附近的时候一定要被太阳引力场的光线要偏折。
This prediction was later confirmed by experimental observations.,那么这个被实验所观测证实了。
This verification completely demonstrated the superiority of General relativity over Newton's theory and got it more widely accepted.,正是这个观测彻底确立了广义相对论理论比牛顿理论的优越性，也当时使得广义相对论理论得到了广泛的接受。
Is General Relativity still flawless today?,广义相对论理论今天有没有缺陷？
"If we want to prove it as the most beautiful scientific theory ever, we first need to discuss whether it is flawed.",如果我说它是最美的科学理论，我们当然需要讨论它有没有缺陷。
"In the sense of applicability, it may feel hard to tell.",从实用上实用性方面来讲你可以说哎呀不好懂这个理论。
"Of course, this is not the fault of Einstein.",当然这不是爱因斯坦的错对不对。
We feel difficult to judge its applicability because we have not truly understood it.,不好懂是你没有学会。
Is it flawed theoretically?,那理论上有没有缺陷？
We know it is in conflict with some ideas in quantum theory.,我们知道现在有一些问题和量子理论不和谐。
I hope that Professor Pan may help us to solve this conflict in future.,呃将来当然我们期待潘教授把这个问题给解决了，好的。
"At this moment, we are not yet in the position to decide whether quantum theory or general relativity is wrong.",但是目前我们不知道是量子理论错了还是广义相对论错了。
"In the case of singularity, Einstein denied the existence of black hole predicted by his own theory, but he believed that it is possible to avoid singularities.",奇点的问题，爱因斯坦不相信他自己的理论所预言的黑洞，但是他认为自然界有可能能够避免奇点。
Quantum physicists believed that the avoidance of singularity in quantum theory impossible.,当然量子物理学家，是认为量子理论有可能能够绕开奇点的问题。
"However, none of these efforts has been successful.",但是今天这些努力都还没有成功。
I myself have done some research on singularity.,关于奇点的问题，我自己曾经做过研究。
My research shows that there is actually no singularity inside the black hole.,我的研究的结果，如果他让我往前走的话我会告诉大家，我的研究结果表明黑洞内部事实上是没有奇点的。
We do not need new laws of nature.,但是并不需要新的自然规律。
"Instead, we need have a better understanding and application of General Relativity.",只需要好好地理解和应用广义相对论。
This is me time-traveling to report this result to Einstein a few years ago.,这是几年前我穿越回去向爱因斯坦老师汇报这个结果。
Flawless!,真的没有缺陷！
"Therefore, Einstein's theory is still the most common yet flawless science theory for us today.",所以爱因斯坦的理论在我们今天看来仍然是不常见没缺陷的极致。
We are still expecting uncommon phenomena predicted by the general relativity.,我们还在期待更多的广义相对论预言的不常见。
"For example, gravitational waves.",比如说引力波。
"Rumor has it, or news has it, that gravitational waves have been detected.",啊现在科学界在谣传哈，也可能是真的哈，就说已经探测到了引力波。
"If that is truly the case, that's something deserving a Nobel Prize.",如果是这样，这必然是一个诺贝尔奖。
"Of course, we are looking forward to more surprises brought by this theory.",当然我们是期待着这个广义相对预言的不常见将给我们带来很多的呃意外。
So what is the driving force of social development?  What is the nature of scientific and technological innovation?,最后再讲一句话，社会发展的动力和科学技术创新的本质到底是什么？
Let us give an answer using our law of beauty.,我们用一下这个美学理论做一下解释。
There is no beauty that is universally applicable; beauty is of diversified forms.,没有普世美，只有多样美。
"As we have discussed in this speech, the vitality of beauty comes from its diversity.",我刚才已经接讲了，有多样美才有生命力。
There is no end to beauty.,没有最美只有更美。
"So, by pursuing beauty, we are actually driving our society forward.",追求更美因此就是社会发展的动力。
"As practitioners in engineering, we know that technological innovation is about remedying weakness, and the ultimate purpose of scientific innovation is to find what uncommon.",技术创新我们做工科的都知道目的就是要弥补缺陷，而科学创新的目的是发现不常见。
"Therefore, my conclusion is this: the driving force of social development and the essence of technology innovation is the pursuit of beauty.",所以因此我的结论就是：社会发展的动力和歌科技创新的本质就是对美的追求。
This is the end of my speech.,我的报告就到这里。
Thank you!,谢谢大家！
"Good evening, everyone!",呃各位朋友晚上好！
"Today, I’d like to talk about Men and Robots.",今天我给大家讲题题目是人与机器人。

"But at that very moment, I regarded the robot as a little kid, or a pal.",但是在那个时刻我其实是把机器人当成了一个小孩儿，当成了一个小伙伴。
He did so because he had stayed in our office too long and wanted to go out and meet people.,他在我们的办公室里坐的时间太长啦，他想出去逛一逛，去跟人接触，嗯。
One must wonder what technological level this robot has reached now.,那么，呃故事故事之后我们这边可能是想看一下，这个机器人目前到底是已经达到了什么样的一个技术水平。

"It takes little effort for a man to stand still, which is a natural result of brain-legs coordination.",我们人站在这里，很简单，这是我们已经形成了条件反射的一个就是大脑很自然形成了一个站立站立状态。
"For a robot, however, standing still is by no means easy, particularly when in motion.",但是机器人在站立的过程中，尤其是在运动的过程中。
"Just now we saw him stood on one leg when playing Tai Chi. How to bring a sense of balance to robot, particularly humanoid robot was a long-term challenge to robot industry.",刚才我们其实在看到跳太极拳他单腿站立怎么样实现机器人的平衡，尤其是人型机器人，这是一直以来困扰呃机器人行业的一个很大的一个难题。
Now this challenge of balance has almost been tackled by us.,现在我们可以看到，就是说机器人的平衡性上我们已经解决得比较不错了。

"In the near future, robots are expected to replace seeing-eye dogs and work more intelligently and reliably.",我们目前用的是导盲犬，应该在不久的将来机器人能够代替导盲犬的工作，并且它更加智能更加稳定。
"Robots can also help us take care of kids, and assist kids to learn a language.",打个比方，这个机器人在我们的陪伴陪伴小孩儿、帮助小孩儿去学习语言。
Take this robot as an example.,因为现在咱们看到这个机器人。
He speaks eight major languages and has the ability of speech synthesis and recognition.,他具备八种语言的能力，就说主主流的语言、语音的合成、语音识别，它都能做。
I’d like to say a few more words about the companionship with the elderly.,另外呢就是陪伴老人。
Our society now is faced with an increasing aging population.,老人在家里，目前我们的社会老龄化越来越严重。
"Yet, the younger generation, busy with their work, has little time to stay with their elders at home.",以后年轻人在外面工作非常忙，可能没有时间在家里陪伴老人。
"Given that, robots can take their place in reading e-mails and news for the elderly.",这个时候我们机器人可以代替这份工作，他可以帮助老人读邮件、帮老人读新闻。
"Also, robots can play a role in the IoT.",另外呢就是说在物联网。
The IoT is now a much-talked-about concept.,物联网现在这个概念是非常热的一个概念。
Smart home is an important part of the IoT and has been included in the 12th “Five-Year Plan”.,智能家居是物联网其中一个很重要的一个分支，这也是当前十二五规划其中的一部分。
"In fact, none of the home appliances such as TV and fridge in a home is smart.",智能家具呢，每个家庭里面的设备，它是没有智能的，也就是说我们的电视，我们的冰箱它本身是不带智能的。
"Smart home is enabled by a smart platform interconnecting all the home appliances, which is ideally supposed to be a robot.",但是如何把这些家电联系起来这时候是我们是需要一个平台的，这时候机器人是最佳，最合适的一个平台。
"A robot has a lot of sensors, which can integrate all electrical equipments.",他可以把所有的电气设备集成起来，因为我们的机器人里边包含了很多的传感器。
"His eyes, for example, are in fact infrared sensors, which can help turn the TV on.",例如现在咱们看的这个眼睛，眼睛其实是红外线的传感器，它可以帮助我们把电视开开。

"Featuring some man-like capabilities, the robot can speak, walk and communicate with children.",因为机器人呢他具备了我们人的一个行为能力，具备了人的一个特征，他可可以说话、可以行走、可以跟小孩去交流。
"Yet, kids do not regard him as a real person, but a doll or a little playmate.",但是小孩并没有把他当当做一个人，只是把他当成一个玩具或者一个小伙伴。
"So, they’d like to play with it.",所以非常愿意跟机器人之间一起玩耍。
"There is a code of robots' conduct, which consists of three points.",机器人的有一个三定律。
"First, robots should neither hurt anyone, nor stand by idly when seeing someone hurt.",第一，机器人不能伤害人，同时不能看到人受伤害的时候而袖手旁观。
"Second, robots must follow men’s instructions and at the same time not breach the first point.",第二，机器人必须遵守人的指令，同时第二条还不能与第一条相违背。
"Third, robots must protect themselves and at that same time not breach the first and second point.",第三条是机器人必须自我保护自己，同时不能和第一条和第二条相违背。
This is a generally accepted code of robots' conduct in our industry.,这是我们目前业界比较公认的一个行为标准，机器人的一个行为标准。
"Yet, our observance of the three points may result in being conquered or enslaved by robots.",但是遵循我们目前的机器人三定律的话，很可能产生的一个结果就是机器人把我们人统治了，把我们人圈养了。
"We may consider the first point that “robots should neither hurt anyone, nor stand by idly when seeing someone hurt” to be the most important of all.",因为我们可以留意得到第一条，第一条是最最重要的，机器人它不能去伤害人同时它还要保证人不能受伤害的。
"In reality, however, man hurts each other from time to time.",但是我们要知道我们人和人之间很多的时候是互相在伤害的。
"Under such circumstances, robots will fall into disorder, not knowing whether to follow one side’s instructions or to protect the other.",这个时候机器人会存会陷入一个逻辑的混乱，它是该保护人还是应还是听人的命令。
"Based on the code of robots' conduct, we need to think about the relationship between robots and men.",我们在说完几条定律之后，我们需要思考的是到底机器人跟人之间应该是一个什么样的关系。
Should robots be subordinate to men?,机器人是应该听从我们的人、服从我们的人？
Or should they be equal to men like our partners or friends?,还是机器人跟人我们是一个平等的一个状态，机器人是我们的伙伴，机器人是我们的朋友？
I will leave this question to you.,这是我留给大家一起思考的一个问题。
"Perhaps in twenty or thirty years, our audience here, your children, or even children’s children will come here for this program again and listen to our speech.",有可能二十年后，三十年后我们在坐的观众，小孩儿或者或者是小孩儿的小孩儿，这个时候我们又来到了听道，接着听我们听道的这样的演讲。
"It’s highly likely that the speaker will not be me, but some robot.",可能有有很大的可能这个时候坐在这里或者是站在这里去讲的人已经不是我了，很有可能是机器人。
But I do hope that I will not be the topic.,但是我希望的是，这个时候被讲的不要是我。
So much for today.,好，这是我今天讲的。
Thank you!,谢谢！
"I have been asked many times lately by our media friends that if I'm in the real world a submissive guy, or a wuss, like Su Chun, a compliant husband I played in Dwelling Narrowness, given my excellent performance in that TV series.",最近呢，好多媒体朋友呀问我一些问题，说是《蜗居》里边的姐夫怕老婆，窝囊，演得非常好，那么你生活中是不是也是这么一个窝囊的人呢。
"Well, I was actually struggling to answer such a shallow question very time they challenged me with it.",每次他们媒体问到我这个问题的时候，我都觉得特别没有营养。
"However, I tried to put it this way,""Su Chun in Dwelling Narrowness, as well as Ma Ming in Mother’s War and Chen Yufei in the recent hit Good Days, are figures I have played.""",嗯我会跟他们这么说，呃我说：“《蜗居》里面的苏淳，《母亲战争》里面的马鸣，包括最近我们热播的《要过好日子》里面的陈宇飞，都是我塑造的角色。”
And I play many roles in my real life too.,那么现实生活中呢，我也会经常地不断地变换角色。
"I am a husband to my wife, a father in front of my son, and ""a damn good actor"" for my audiences online.",比如说回到家里面我是一名丈夫；在儿子面前呢，我是一名父亲；在很多网友面前呢，我的角色名字叫“郝平如潮”。
What I’m trying to say is that each and every one of us is in fact an actor.,那么也就是说啊现实生活中的这些角色呢。
"We are all playing our roles, day in day out.",我们每个人其实都在不停地扮演着。
Let me take our cameraman as an example. He is now shooting us down on one knee; but it’s also possible that he’s the boss of a company.,比如说咱们现在半跪下来，咱们的摄影师，可能他现在扮演的是摄影师，也可能您是一名公司的老总。
"As I known, the doorkeeper out there really runs a company, but at this very moment, he is playing the role of a doorkeeper.",包括我了解了一下啊，说咱们门口看大门儿的，他还就是一名公司的老总，但是他现在扮演的角色是看门人。
"That’s it, our roles change.",也就是说这个角色呀在现实生活中不停地变换。
"As for me, actors usually keep a narrow circle of friends.",我呢，我们这个圈子呢比较窄。
"But there are actuall some roles that I know well, that is the TV crew, or the film crew in some cases.",在我身边呢有很多我非常了解的角色，那么就是摄制组，你们俗话叫剧组。
"So, what makes a crew?",那么剧组是什么东西构成的呢？
"In fact, it’s a large group of people playing different roles, such as producers, executive producers, production directors, assistant directors, cameramen, the cast, gaffers, art designer, sound engineers, to name a few.",其实由不同的角色构成的，比如说制片人、执行制片人、制片主任、副导演、摄影、演员、灯光、舞美、录音等等等等等等。
"But, instead of chattering about directors, producers, or the cast, I’d like to bring you closer to assistant director, a very, very important role that deserves much more attention than it does now.",那么在这儿呢我不想提呃导演，也不想提制片人，也不想提我们演员，在这里呢我想提一提我们这个非常非常重要的角色但是又被人往往忽视掉的角色——副导演。
How much do you know about the jobs of an assistant director?,我不知道在座的朋友对副导演有多少了解？
"Many of you would probably say that assistant director is the guy who stands by the monitor and give the well-known ""ready-and-action"" order.",可能好多人了解只是停留在监视器旁边喊“预备321开始”那个人。
"Yes, that’s his job, but only a quite small part of an extensive to-do list.",没错确实是他，但是，那个太片面了。
What exactly does an assistant director do?,什么是副导演呢？
"Technically, an assistant director should assist the director in doing some pre-production jobs, from the selection of locations, actors and actresses, to the coordination of music staff, art designers, stylists, gaffers, and cameramen.",副导演呢是，呃我按照学术一点的说哦，就是在影片拍摄前期准备阶段协助导演，请注意听是“协助”，协助导演完成外景选择，演员选择，联系音乐、美工、造型、灯光、摄影等等等等部门的艺术创作。
"During the entire shooting process, assistant director should arrange scenes well, and assist the director in maintaining everything on site in order, or checking the site, till the end of shooting.",直到进入拍摄的期间，副导演呢负责片场排戏，还是协助导演进行现场指挥，或者说检查拍戏的现场，直到影片全部结束。
Maybe I was a bit wordy.,可能我这么有些啰嗦哦。
"So, technically an assistant director is basically a utility man.",严格意义来说呢副导演是什么呢，是一个干杂活儿的人。
"On the contrary, the director generally sits behind the monitor and rarely engages in any on-site arrangements.",嗯导演呢往监视器前一坐，导演一般很少去现场去调度。
"For example, we are going to shoot a big scene today.",嗯今天我们拍一个大场面的戏。
What is it like then?,什么戏呢？
"Let’s say that we have a lofty fortification wall in place, some soldiers on its top, and some at its foot.",有一个我们搭的一个城楼，很高，城楼上准备一帮士兵，城楼下面准备一帮士兵。
"So, what is the story here?",我们这场戏的要求是什么呢？
Soldiers at the foot are to attack the city.,是城楼下面这些士兵呢要往上攻城。
Then the assistant director should prepare for the shooting.,副导演去准备吧。
"So, he goes all the way to select some lucky dogs from more than a hundred of extras on his contact list.",于是副导演就搭块儿毛巾，啊一路小跑，就来到了他联系好的上百个群众演员里面，然后呢张三李四王麻子全部都挑好了。
This is the time when he receives a hundred some costumes from costumers and begin his busiest hours of the day.,然后呢这个时候呢，我们的服装老师就会把上百件的各式各样的衣服交给他手里面，这个时候副导演开始进行他一天最忙碌的工作。
"Generally, the cast, director, cameramen have not arrived yet at this moment, but the assistant director was already on site.",往往这个时候工作的时候，是我们演员包括导演包括摄影、灯光还没有出发的时候，他已经提前到现场了。
He has to ensure that extras are properly dressed and positioned.,他要监督演员要把这个服装穿好，形象稍微好一点的呢。
The good-looking ones in front and other at back.,他们安排在前面，稍微形象差一点儿的安排在后面。
"After that, he will also put on a costume for extras and tell soldiers on the ground: ""The line is ‘Fight for blah blah blah’, you shout it out with me and run.""",然后呢他会主动地把群众演员的服装穿上，他说：“你们跟着我喊，为了什么什么我们开始死视死如归”就开始冲。
"And then he will rush to the defense troops on top of the wall and tell them their lines, ""We can't have them come up here because blah blah blah.""",然后呢，他就又再再跑的那个城楼上面给那些守城的人说：“为了什么什么我们不能让他们攻上城。”
It may take a whole morning for him to get all those things done.,这样子步等来回这跑完跑后，等来回把这些演员的服装穿好了之后啊，可能一个上午就过去了。
"And that is the time when the director, cameramen or gaffers come to the site, asking if everything is ready.",然后这个时候导演或者摄影或者灯光才来到现场，就问他准备的怎么样了。
"The answer is ""Yes"" in most cases.",一般这个时候都会准备得差不多。
Cameramen and gaffers will then get prepared.,然后就看见我们就说各个部门准备灯光，准备摄影。
"Right before the shooting, the assistant director will smear his face with dark make-ups and join the group of extras.",然后我们的副导演就会首当其冲地把自己的脸抹得很黑，然后呢就混在群众演员堆里面进行开始拍摄。
The site is often less organized at that moment.,往往这个时候呢现场比较混乱。
"Everyone, including the director and cameramen, is waiting for the signal from the assistant director.",导演呢没有话语权，摄影没有话语权，只有副导演有话语权。
"Cameras will start rolling only when the assistant director holds the walkie-talkie and says: ""All in place, let’s roll.""",只有副导演把那个对讲机拿到手里头说：“一切全部准备好了，可以开机了”，这个时候呢才能开机。
"In other words, assistant director is a vital position, which is extremely challenging, but often overlooked.",也就是说呢，这个副导演的工作是极其重要的，但又是极其辛苦的，但又往往是被人们忽视的。
"At times, you could see award-winners of some viral TV shows or films giving their speech at ceremonies.",往常有的时候我们一部片子火了，或者片子大卖了。
"They said ‘Thank you’ to TV channels, directors, producers, and scenarists.",我们有些人获奖了，站在领奖台上永远说我感谢什么什么TV啊，感谢我们的导演、感谢制片人、感谢编剧。
Rarely had I heard they were grateful for what the assistant director had done.,但很少有人听到说感谢副导演的。
"To be honest, I had no idea about why there are so many people choosing to be an assistant director, given the fact that the role is challenging and arduous.",所以就这个问题呢其实也挺纠结我的，我说副导演这个角色既然这么难做，既然这么辛苦，为什么还会有这么多人去做副导演。
So I talked to one of my friends who were doing the job.,那么我在我的身边有很多副导演的朋友，有的时候我们经常会沟通啊。
I asked him: “You just finished another hard task and you were injured. Why not just stop doing this?”,我说：“你前两天刚拍完这个戏很辛苦的，你又受了伤，嗯你为什么还要做呀？”
"He said: ""I don't know what to do except this one. Cameraman needs expertise, so does the gaffer. Acting is even more challenging.""",他说：“我不干这个我不会干其他的啊，他说摄影啊那是完全纯专业，灯光也是，演戏更不行了。”
"""You don’t totally count on social connections to keep your career, do you?"" I asked again.",我说：“那你就是完全靠人际关系吗？”
"""Basically, yes,"" he answered.",他说：“基本上是靠人际关系了。”
He has been working as an assistant director for many years.,然后呢他就一直从事着这个副导演的工作，一直做了很多年。
"Sometimes, assistant director can be the most dangerous position at the filming location.",嗯，有些时候在我们拍戏现场呢，发生危险最多的其实也是副导演。
I took a part in the TV series called Golden Wool last year.,我去年拍了一部电视剧，叫《金羊毛》。
"There was a scene where I was riding a horse, trying to escape from a group of arrestors.",有一个场面是我骑着马后面有很多的人在追，也骑着马。
I played for some close-up shots while my substitute or my director friend played for some wide shots.,然后呢有一些近景镜头的时候是我演的，然后一些全景镜头的时候就有可能是替身或者就是由我这个朋友副导演来演的。
Accidents happen at shooting.,嗯在拍戏当中啊经常会发生一些磕磕碰碰。
"For instance, one day we were shooting a horse chasing scene, one of the horses tripped.",比如说有一天我们正在拍一场骑马追逐的戏，其中就有一匹马，马失前蹄。
"There were lots of horses running and since the scene was shot on a grassland, it was easy for the horses to step into some of the rat holes on the grass and trip.","因为我们有很多马在跑嘛,嗯因为我们当时选择了在一个外一个外景啊很多草地上面有很多那种田鼠洞，马蹄子正好陷在田鼠洞就会马失前蹄。"
"When my friend was on the back of a running horse, wearing a costume, the horse was suddenly trapped and fell.",然后呢那名副导演呢穿着另外一名演员的服装就骑在马上跑，哐镗一下子就马失前蹄了。
He was thrown forward and smashed against the ground.,从马上凌空飞到路面。
A few staff on site tried to help him.,然后呢旁边好多工作人员一看就呦那个副导演谁谁谁怎么摔下去了，就想往前去救他。
"The cameraman or assistant cameraman stopped the staff and yelled at him, ""Are you insane? How dare you! His fall will be worthless if you help him now.""",然后呢摄影或者摄影助理，一脚就把这个想去救他的工作员踹倒了，就指着他说：“你疯了，你怎么敢去救他呀？你要去救他他这个他这个镜头他就白摔了。”
"So we all had to wait until the director said ""OK"".",哦然后我们所有人都等这条镜头拍完导演喊“过”。
"When we reached the assistant director, I found his leg like this, broken.",然后我们再冲上就去看我那名受伤的副导演，忽然发现他的腿呀，变成这样子了，就是其实是骨折了。
"We all felt bad that day, complaining the difficulties of this role.",然后呢，我就啧大家大家都心都很心酸，就说这个职业特别不好干。
"A couple of days ago, I went to the hospital to see him, and I couldn’t help griping about his choice, saying that some of his ex-coworkers were doing a better job.",然后呢，跟他在医院包括前不久我也到医院去看他，我说你为什么到今天为止还选择副导演呢？我说你的师兄师弟们有的人汗干得比你好。
"However, he said something that touched me so much, and he said: ""I didn't receive professional trainings in the first place; I didn't go to a professional college, either. The only reason that supports me to hang in there is that I want to become a director one day.""",他说了一句话，让我非常感动，他说：“我第一没有经受过专业的训练，我也没有从专业的院校毕业，我能干副导演在今天，我的梦想就是总有一天我会成为一名导演。”
"It’s true that quite a few of his ex-coworkers were once assistant directors and have become well-known directors, such as the action director of Once Upon a Time in China III, stared by Li Lianjie.",然后我的这名朋友呢，他的师兄弟呢，很多人也都是干副导演的，也确确实实有很多人已经成为了有名的副导演了，比如说，我们最早看的李连杰先生演的一部电影叫《狮王争霸》，里面的动作导演就是他的师兄弟。
"A lot of big names in the entertainment or filmmaking industry also worked as assistant director, such as Zhang Yimou and John Woo.",然后在这个里面呢有很多我们的我们这个娱乐圈儿或者说电影电视圈儿里面有很多的一些大名人都从事过副导演，比如说张艺谋先生，比如说吴宇森先生。
"Zhang Guoli, a famous Chinese actor that was once an assistant director and Zhang Jizhong, a producer that also worked as assistant director.",还有就是说嗯我们这个行当里面从副导演转行做演员也成为大明星的张国立先生，还有转行做制片人的张纪中先生，他们都做过副导演。
"My point here is that there are people insisting on doing this job or playing this role, and some of them will achieve their goal because they never give up their dreams.",那么也就是说这个行当啊，就这个角色，到今天为止还有人在做，一定是有人成功的，那么这些人呢一直在寻求自己的梦想。
"Speaking of which, I think some members of the younger generation are somewhat impetuous. This thought may be inspired by the atmosphere today – it’s Youth Day.",呃说到这个话题呢可能也确确实实跟今天是五四青年节有关系哈，我就觉得我们这一代的年轻人呢有些浮躁。
College students today wish to get a “high-paid easy job” immediately after their graduation.,或者说我的师弟呀师妹们刚刚从大学毕业之后，就很想找一些不愿意吃苦的工作，找一些呃薪水比较高的工作。
They probably haven’t been aware that challenging roles like assistant director are actually the best for their growth.,但他们恰恰却忘了，往往像副导演之类的角色，其实是最锻炼人的。
Let’s jump out the circle of filmmaking industry.,不光说我们摄制组。
You guys here must come from sectors where there are similar roles like an assistant director.,其实在座的各行各业可能都存在很多副导演之类的角色。
You may call it production director or something else.,我们或许把他叫做制片主任或许把它叫做什么什么。
I don't know.,我不知道啊。
"But I know for sure that there must be someone in your workplace who does the coordinating and communicating work or do the chores, just like an assistant director.",但是我相信你们的工作单位中一定会有一些人从事着启承转下、通知或者说干些杂活儿的这些人，那么往往他们忽视了一个东西，其实这个副导演呢。
They are actually within one arm’s reach to the gold.,或者说这种角色的人呢是离黄金最近的人。
"They have the opportunity to learn a lot from the director, the cameraman and the cast.",因为他可以从大导演那里学到很多的东西，可以从摄影那里学到很多东西，可以从演员那里学到表演。
They can acquire many skills by learning from other departments.,可以从其他部门学到非常非常多的营养。
"I believe they will grasp a chance one day, and become a great director.",我想直到有一天如果说他有机会了，他一定也会成为一名非常棒的名导演。
"Finally, I’d like to share with you my motto: the boundary of your ambition determines how high you can fly; and your achievements depend on how big you dare to dream.",嗯最后呢想再多说两句话，呃这也是给我自己的座右铭，你的志向有多远，你就可以飞得有多高，你的心有多大，你的舞台，就有多大。
Thank you!,谢谢！
"Here at TnDao, I'd like to take advantage of this special day to share with you the world view of the Chinese.",呃今天来到“听道”的这个现场，在一个特殊的日子，来看一看我们这个中国人哪，呃他是用什么样的方法去看待这个世界的。
"On the slide, there is a very long chart.",你在这个上面我们看到一个很长的这个图。
"To be brief, from the chart, you can see the tall columns.",其实这个图我，简单地说你看到那个高高的那个柱子。
"Here's one question for us: ""What do you believe in?""",这个问题我们说：“你相信什么？”
"The tallest column represents the answer of people who ""believes in nothing"", which is the main stream among the Chinese people.",然后大家看到的最高高的柱子是说“我什么也不信”，这个什么也不信是我们中国人中间的主流。
"However, it is quite interesting to ask these atheists further.",但是这个什么也不信的人，我们再去问一下他，就很有意思。
"The reason is that some atheists say, ""Although I believe in nothing, I believe in destiny.""",因为什么都不信人中间说：“虽然我什么都不信，但我相信有命的。”
"Some say, ""Although I believe in nothing, I believe in luck.""",还有一种人说：“虽然我什么都不信，但我是信有运的。”
"Some say, ""Although I believe in nothing, I believe in constellation.""",还有一种人说：“虽然我什么都不信，但是我相信是有星座的。”
Have you got it now?,知道吧？
This is the so-called atheists among us.,所以这就是我们这个无神论者啊。
"They are the people who believe in the probability factors, so they cannot be regarded as the real atheists.",其实是一个或然性，相信或然性因素的人，他不是真正的无神论者。
"When it comes to theists, it is also very interesting.",那我们的有神论呢，也很有意思。
"Based on the chart, we could notice that the theists believe in different things.",大家看到这个我们相信有这个某种东西存在的这个人群，可以看到这个里面是信不同的。
Some people state that they are Buddhists.,有的人说我是信佛的。
"Buddhists account for the largest proportion among the theists in China, reaching 18%.",因为中国最多的就是18%的人说我信佛。
Over 2% of people proclaim that they are Christians while some say they are Catholics.,然后呢有百分之二点几的人很明确地说我是基督徒，还有一些人说我是天主教的。
The amount of Christians and Catholics in total takes about 10%.,我把基督徒和天主教加在一起的话，大概是10%左右。
Buddhists occupy the largest proportion for 18%.,那个最高的是信佛的18%。
The Buddhists are also quite interesting.,但是这个信佛的又很有意思。
"Someone says: ""It's good that you believe in Buddhism. How much do you know about Buddhism?""",有人说：“你信佛很好，关于佛你到底知道一些什么？”
"""Amitabha.""",“阿弥陀佛。”
"“In addition to Amitabha, do you know anything else?""",“那除了阿弥陀佛你还知道？”
"""Om Mani Padme Hum.""",“就是有个什么嘛咪嘛咪吽。”
"""Anything else?""",“那你还知道什么？”
"""Um-um. I’m sorry. I really don’t know. Buddhism is all about doing good deeds, accumulating virtue and showing magnanimity.""",“哼哼，不好意思我真的不知道，做点好事嘛，积善嘛，行德嘛。”
"Well, only 0.4% of people have read some scriptures.",好了，只有0.4％的人因为某种原因，所以呢他读过一段经。
"For example, some Buddhists may learn about the Great Compassion Mantra, or they have read it, who are already considered knowledgeable.",比如说知道《大悲咒》，诶，正儿八经人家念过一遍经的，那属于相当有学问的人。
Most people say that they have faith in Buddhism.,大部分的人呢说我信佛。
How do they show their faith?,那信的方法就是什么呢？
"If there is a temple, they will enter the temple and say that they know the bodhisat, but cannot tell out the name.",就是诶这是个庙，这知道，对吧，进到庙里说这菩萨我知道，但菩萨叫什么我不知道。
"After entering the temple, they'll buy a bunch of incenses.",那个然后进进去以后买买一炷香，就我们那一般买就买一扎对吧。
"Then, they will place one stick in front of each Bodhisattva.",下以后就知道每一个那个菩萨面前就这个地方放一炷，这个地方放一炷，这个地方放一炷。
How does that work?,那说你放了有什么用？
"I also don't know, because I don't know what this Bodhisattva is in charge for and I don't know their responsibilities.",我也不知道有什么用，因为我不知道他是干嘛的，就是不知道他具体管什么工作。
You see.,你知道。
"However, to play safe, one stick is placed in front of each deity statue.",但是呢保险的方法就是凡神面前一炷香。
"After all, incenses won't cost a lot.",就哈反正香也没多少钱嘛。
"For example, 10 yuan for one bunch.",那比如总共十块钱买一扎对吧。
"The cost of very two sticks is very low, isn't it?",一个上面弄2根，2根，2根，你你每个成本它都很低的，对吧？
"I recently invested a total of 350,000 yuan to buy stocks.",但是想想说最近我一共投资了35万买股票。
The price of stocks tends to rise.,看着往上走往上走。
I wish it won't go down next Monday.,下周星期一别别到哎到周一又往下跌啊，对吧。
"If the price goes up next Monday, I will sell out on Tuesday.",下周一千万上一上，我就周二准备抛。
"The incenses bought in 10 yuan are expected to bless you with 100,000 yuan.",好嘛，十块钱卖的香想保佑你10万块钱。
What is the ratio of input to output?,这什么投入产出比呀？
So some of us regard deities as fools.,所以啊，我们在里面有一些人是把神当傻帽的。
It is unlikely that the deities are more foolish than the ordinary people.,因为神哪有比你还傻呀。
"You buy a bunch of incenses in ten yuan and just give two sticks to each deity, but you ask for two percent of price increase of your stock in return.",你你用十块钱卖的香，还一人只分了两根儿，然后你要求的是涨俩点。
"However, many of the followers of faiths just think in this way.",但是你知道吗，这就是我们很多的所谓信徒。
"They enslave the deities and claim, ""I believe in Buddhism!""",所以这叫神奴主义者，把神是当奴隶的，然后还说：“我是信佛的！”
"Christians are a little better, because 94% of Christians have read the Bible.",基督徒呢稍微好一点点，因为基督徒中间94%的人是念过《圣经》的。
"In comparison of the Buddhists and Christians, the amount of Christians is less but Christians know much more about their religion.",所以这两个比较呢，虽然它的总数少，但它知道的人会比较多一点。
"However, there are also some muddleheaded people among Christians!",但是我们基督徒里面也有很多糊涂的哦！
"Many Christians also say, ""Dear God, the Buddha which I used to believe in is not efficient, so I often lost the money in the stock market. Later, I heard that you are omnipotent. As you are omnipotent, you must also be the God of the stock market. Is that correct? Therefore, I have decided to believe in you and hope you can help increase the price of stock by two percent within one week. Also, I know that you are better than the Bodhisattva, because you don’t even need me to offer incenses. It's much better to believe in you, because the price of my stock can rise by two percent without any expense.""",因为基督徒信的时候也有很多说：“哎呀，呵呵，上帝，以前我信那个佛不是很灵，嘿，你看哈我炒股就是老亏的，后来呢听说你是万能的，那么万能当然也应该是股神啦，对吧？所以我现在决定信你啦，然后希望星期一上两个点，呵呵呵。而且我知道你呀比那个菩萨还好，因为你连那个两根香都不要。所以我觉得这个真的是比较好，白白地捞两个点，呵这个比较好。”
"Therefore, when some people believe in one religion, they want something in return.",所以有的人他信的时候，其实还是要得一样东西的。
"Essentially, for many people, the faith is merely a tool to fulfill their material needs and a tool to help realize their will.",所以从本质上来说，我们很多人的信念它在根底里是一个物质工具，是帮实现我们人的意志的工具。
"So if we observe the theism and atheism together, we will find that either of them is quite special, in a Chinese characteristic way.",那这就是我们如果说你把我们所谓的有神论和所谓的无神论搁在一起的话，你发现这个有神论无神论都很有特点，都非常有中国的特色。
"We don't judge here, but in my opinion, it's good that people have faiths.",呃咱们不去评价这个是非，就我个人来说呢，我认为一个人有点儿信仰总是好的。
What advantages do people with faith get?,因为有信仰的人有什么好处呢？
People who believe in positive power usually have some positive pursuits.,信仰正的力量的人啊他通常都会追求一点好的事情。
"As you all know, regardless of their faiths, theists usually believe that it's right to do some good deeds, because every kind of deity is pleased to have people do so.",你知道吧，比如说不管信什么宗教的一般都会相信做一点善事那是没错的，因为不管是哪一种神都高兴人做一点善事。
This is the faith.,所以这是呃所信仰的。
"In addition, some people don't know whether there is a God or deity, but they believe the existence of ghosts.",还有呢有的人呢他不知道哪儿有什么神啊上帝，但他知道有鬼。
"There is one advantage of believing in ghosts, because people will believe in hell or the underworld.",信鬼其实也有一点好处的，因为一看啊说哦，你看嘛这就是地狱。
"In hell, there are various punishments, including steaming, frying, braising, roasting, and nowadays they can cook you on a iron griddle or with electric devices .",将来或者是那个所谓的地府，到了地府里面有清蒸的，有油炸的，有红烧的，还有那个干烤很长时间的，现在还有铁板锅的，还有电烤的。
"Therefore, it comes to his mind, ""Gosh! Why are people suffering from these punishments?""",所以他就想：“诶呀妈呀！这些人为什么会受这个苦呢？”
"Someone tells him, ""Do you know that if people commit this kind of crimes, they'll be steamed; if they commit that kind of crimes, they'll be sliced.""",就有人告诉你说：“你知道吗？像这种人呢就是犯这种罪的，就是清蒸，哼，像这种人呢就切肉丝，哼。”
"Then, he'll say to himself, ""No, I'd better do some good deeds and do nothing evil. Otherwise, I will end up being made into a Manchu Han Imperial Feast. Right?""",然后说：“哟，这不行，哼，我还是干点好事得了，别别干那么大的坏事儿，干那么多坏事儿，完了以后将来都变成满汉全席了，是吧？”
"So, if there is something horrible, you'll fear about it.",所以诶你有点儿这个的话呢，你就有些畏惧。
It is true for human being.,其实人你看就是这样。
"In the following minutes, I would like to share some particularly interesting ideas with you.",那我想下面跟大家分享的东西是特别有意思的，什么呢。
What are the Chinese people afraid of on earth?,就是这中国人到底怕什么东西？
"We may say that the Chinese fear nothing, but in fact, there are somethings that we do fear.",我们说中国人什么也不怕，我跟你说中国人还真有怕的。
What are Chinese people particularly afraid of?,中国人特别怕什么呢？
"Firstly, diseases. The most fearful things are diseases.",怕病，第一最怕的就是生病，
"Besides, Chinese fear that their relatives fall ill.",而且还怕亲人生病。
That is something.,哦，有意思啊。
What is the second dreadful thing?,第二个是怕什么呢？
Becoming impoverished.,怕变得穷。
What else?,然后还有一个是什么呢？
To lose the social position and be despised by others.,就怕失去地位，就这个人整天被人家看不起。
Anything else?,然后呢还有怕什么呢？
Chinese are afraid of being misunderstood by friends among others.,怕被朋友误解，啊等等这些。
It's quite interesting if we compare the Chinese with the American.,这个我们如果把中国人和美国人做个对比很有意思。
What do the Chinese fear most?,中国人你知道最怕的是什么呢？
First it is poverty.,第一就是怕穷。
Then they fear sickness.,然后你说他再怕什么呢，中国人除了怕穷之外他还怕有一些东西是，你看它是穷和生病啊这两种。
"Of course, they fear also the war.",当然也怕打仗。
"In addition,they are afraid of loneliness.",另外他还怕什么呢，呃怕孤单寂寞。
"As for Americans, what're they afraid of?",但是呢美国人你说他怕什么？
Snakes.,蛇。
"In addition to snakes, Americans are also afraid of spiders.",不仅怕蛇，嘿美国人还怕一样东西，就那个蜘蛛哦。
27% of Americans are afraid of spiders.,有27％的人很害怕蜘蛛的。
Rats are another dreadful thing for Americans.,他还怕老鼠。
"Then, the Americans are afraid of public speeches.",然后美国人还还还怕个什么呢，公开场合演讲。
They are very afraid of being asked to speak in the public.,就是在公开场合演讲，他非常害怕。
Anything else?,然后呢，这个还有怕什么呢？
They are scared of heights.,怕高度，恐高。
What else?,还怕什么呢？
Being closed in a small room.,关在狭小的屋子里面。
I'm just giving some examples to tell you that the Chinese and the American are really different.,诶我是举一些例子啊，就告诉你中国人和美国人真的是不一样的。
"As human being, from a humanistic point of view, Chinese and Americans have great differences, i.e., their fears.",就是作为人，从人文的角度来说，我们有很重要的不一样，就是我们怕的事儿跟他们怕的事儿，这个有很大区别。
At least what Americans fear are physical.,至少人家怕的那个事儿吧看起来基本上都是一些挺物理的东西。
"For example, firstly, they are more scared of animals than we are.",比如说第一是动物类的，比我们怕得多。
"In addition, they are afraid of narrow spaces, height, planes, injections and other things.",另外呢，他怕一些那个比如说什么小空间啊，高度啊，飞机上飞行啊，还有打针哪什么，诶他怕这些东西。
"However, different from us who fear for poverty and diseases, Americans are less afraid of things related to human beings.",诶但是呢不太像我们这个害怕那个什么贫穷啊，什么生病啊，这个诶所以他跟我们害怕的这个跟人相关的事儿他好像会比较少一点。
"In my speech today, I don't want to overstress the differences between the two people.",但是我在这个里面呃特别强调地还不是想要说我们这个到底有什么区别。
"Instead, how should we deal with our fears?",而是我们在强调说当面对这些东西的时候，我们用什么方法去对待它？
"Among all the fears, many audiences here today may have acrophobia.",在这个所有列出来的这个害怕的项目中间，有一个项目在座的很多人可能会有恐高。
There is a World Financial Center not far away from us.,啊离我们不远的地方，有这个环球金融中心。
"The 100th floor of the center is equipped with transparent glass-floor walkways, so it's a fearful place for many people, including me.",啊我很多人，这个环金中心的100层是个透明的地板，很多人是走不过去的，我也走不过去。
"My psychotherapist told me, ""Do you know? There is only one solution to acrophobia: facing the height.""",但是呢，心理治疗师跟我说，你知道吗，恐高只有一个方法解决，就是你要面对那个高度。
But I can't face it.,但是我没法面对。
"Later, there came a chance. I said to myself that I had to face it for at least one time, so one year, I went to Canada to be the tourism ambassador of Canadian entrepreneurs.",但是后来有一次呵我终于逮着一个机会我说，总是要面对一次嘛，所以我有一年去了加拿大，做加拿大的企业家旅游大使。
It was in 2010.,这是2010年的时候。
"There was a over 1,000 meters' air ride suspension which was called ""Zip chuck"" between two mountain peaks.",他们有一个山峰之间的那个人悬在那个悬索上叫高空悬索zip chuck，这个大概是一千多米吧。
Tourists move through the zip chuck from one mountain peak to another.,人就是悬在上面时候，“ri”从这上头过去，然后“ri”过来。
"At the beginning, I was twisted, because I was that kind of person who would freeze and become completely unable to move at high altitudes.",开始的时候，你知道吗，非常纠结，因为我是那种属于到了高空之后那个脚步完全冻住的，完全不能动的。
"In addition, I found that my legs were so feeble that I could hardly stand, and I had a strong desire to jump off.",而且你会发现这个腿怎么就那么松呢，它就会它就会下去了，而且有一种强烈地想跳下去的愿望。
"As you know, this is the most severe symptom of acrophobia.",你知道这个恐高症最严重的一种。
The patient with acrophobia is so scared of height that he hopes to lower it through jumping off.,就是他对距离的害怕是如此之恐惧，以至于希望通过跳的方法来减低他的距离。
"As people feel uncertain at high altitude, only reaching the ground rapidly can they feel assured.",你知道因为他就是在高度中间是不确定的，只有迅速地到达地面你才获得确定性。
Is it right?,是吧？
"Therefore, the extremely severe acrophobia can force people to jump off buildings.",所以高度的极度的恐高症是会跳楼的。
I was almost at the verge of the extreme fear at that time.,我已经接近于那个水平了。
"When I slided to the opposite side, I felt much better.",对，然后“ri”过去的时候，诶你发现就好一点了。
"Then, when I got back, my mood was further appeased.",然后“ri”过来的时候又好一点。
"Therefore, I went back and forth for seven times.",就整了七个来回以后。
"So, if people want to exceed their own capabilities, they need the help.",所以人在超越他自己力量控制范围的时候，人们需要一种帮助。
This is why the second point that I'm going to talk about is important.,这就是我为什么回到我前面说的这个第二条的时候。
"In 1992, we first made study on the importance of supernatural powers or religious beliefs that transcended natural forces among all the values for humans.",1992年我们第一次研究，说在所有的价值里面人有一个超越自然力，就超自然力的信仰或者说宗教类别信仰，重要吗。
We conducted the first investigation in 1995 and the second one was in 2007.,在95年是第一次做调查，和我们这次调查的时候是2007年。
"After almost 12 years of investigation, we found that in comparison with other countries, the Chinese in general stress less importance on belief.",经过了差不多12年之后再做调查的时候，我们会发现总的来说，我们跟其他国家的人相比较，对于信仰的这个要求还是比人家低一些的。
"However, there is a great improvement compared to that in 1995.",但是跟1995年比有了一个非常大的提高。
"In terms of trajectory, Chinese are paying more attention to faiths.",所以我们从趋势上来说，人们对于信仰的重要性的程度越来越提高了。
"However, one reality about belief remains unchanged, that is the features of our motive.","但是,有一个信仰的状况依然没有改变，就是信仰的由衷模式。"
One feature of our religious motive is tha we claim to believe in nothing while in fact we seem to believe in everything.,"由衷模式的特点就是说，你说我真的信一个什么吗,其实我什么也不信;你说我什么也不信吗,我其实好像都有一点儿信。"
This is the mainstream way of belief among Chinese people.,这是我们中国人中间主流的信仰方式。
"For choosing the belief, the priority is whether the belief can work for us, which is very important.",而且这个信仰方式在信仰的时候，它最重要的是看他能不能给我干活儿，就这件事情非常重要。
"When we regard the deities, whether the almighty God of  the Heaven or the Hell who is the chef of Manchu Han Imperial Feast, as someone who work for us, I think it is necessary to talk about the dignity of human beings that Mr.Hu just talked about.",而当我们把神明不管是上面那个伟大的神明或者底下那个负责呃搞满汉全席的神明啊，不是上面还是下面的，当我们把这个是看做来帮我们办事儿的时候，我觉得回到前面胡老师说的那个人的尊贵性。
Many people will ask what is dignity?,我们很多人说尊贵到底是什么呢？
Is dignity always a legacy of a certain racial culture?,尊贵很多时候是不是一定是一个种族文化的遗存呢？
Not exactly.,也不完全是。
"It seems to me that in addition to some cultural heritance, more importantly, the dignity comes from the fervent pursuit for a certain power from the inner heart so that the people conduct in a way different from the ordinary people.",啊在我看来，这个我们说的呃这个尊贵除了某一些文化的传承之外，有一个非常重要的是内心对于某一种力量的发自内心的炙热的追求，以至于他做出了一般人不会去做的事情。
"For instance, still in her teens, Mother Teresa decided to devote her entire life to God and serve the people.",就像我们看到特蕾莎嬷嬷，呃在她很年轻的时候还是一个少女的时候，她就决定去用自己的一辈子去侍奉上帝，然后去服务普通的穷人。
"In the nun society of Mother Teresa, many young females were born with silver spoons, some of course came from the impoverished families.",你要知道在特蕾莎嬷嬷的那个修女团里面，有很多富二代富三代的这个呃印度的女孩子或者当然是贫二代也有很多。
They didn't marry or seek any own benefits.,她们在一辈子不嫁男人，啊不谋求自己的好处。
"Instead, they helped others.",只去做帮助其他人的事。
They also had an interesting working mode.,而且你知道她们的模式也很有意思。
"Nowadays, it's hard to raise fund for public welfare.",我们今天很多人说公益筹不到钱。
"For them, they only raised food for their weekly needs and raised funds for children they were helping.",她们的模式是每周只为本周吃的饭去筹粮，只为手上那些孩子的需要去筹钱。
"If a rich man came, saying, ""Wow, it’s too hard for you to raise the money. I will give you $800,000 at once!""",如果有一个富人来说：“哇，你筹这个钱太辛苦了，我一次给你80万美金你们慢慢花吧！”
"They would respond, ""Sorry, we can't take it, because we only raise the money we deserve.""",说：“对不起我们不要，因为我们只筹我们当要的这个钱。”
What would they eat next week?,至于下个星期该吃什么呢？
"They said: ""It doesn't matter, God will prepare adequate supply for us next week. If we have so many resources, I am afraid we will be corrupted.""",她们说：“没关系，上帝一定会为我们预备丰富的供应在下一周。 因为若我们持有太多的资源，恐怕我们会被腐败了。”
"Ok, this is the positive pursuit.",ok，所以你看这是我们往上的这个追求。
"However, some people will be affected by fear, because they are afraid that they will go to hell, be punished and be beyond redemption in the future.",但是也有一些人呢，就是因为恐惧，恐惧自己会啊将来下地狱，恐惧将来有一天被烹炸油煮，恐惧有一天会万劫不复。
"Also, some people believe in their chance to reincarnate and fear that they will turn to a dog or a pig in the nex life, so they choose not to face such a prospect.",有的人甚至说本来是有机会转世投胎的，对吧，否则我下回转了，变成一条狗了，或者一条猪啦，所以诶这个我也不要选择这样的一个前景。
"I think, the power of faith allows us to transcend our knowledge and our own limited information and abilities to observe things outside our scope, and give yourself a relatively definitive answer.",所以我觉得在这个里面，信仰的力量，信仰的力量使得我们在超越我们的知识和我们自己有限的信息和能力能够观察范围内以外的事物，你给了自己一个相对确定的答案。
This definitive answer defines the scope and the mode of action for us.,而这个确定的答案为我们划定了一个行动的范围和行动的模式。
"Once the mode is defined, one of the largest benefits is that people can easily identify you when they interact with you.",而当你这个模式确定了之后，一个最大的好处是当其他人跟你交往的时候人们容易辨别你。
"Human is an action subject full of probabilities, speculation, opportunity and uncertainty.",一个充满或然性，充满投机感，充满机会性，充满不确定性的一个行动主体。
"As for every one, dignity is out of the question, but occasionally, noble behaviors cannot be ruled out.",其实对所有人来说，根本谈不上高贵的问题，但是你也不排除偶尔有高贵的行为。
"Generally speaking, human is highly uncertain.",总的来说你是一个高度不确定的。
"We can't simply judge whether the high uncertainty is good or not, because high uncertainty can bring a lot of advantages, including to the readiness to reform, openness to the novel things, enthusiasm for fashion and fashionable items.",但是我们不能简单地说这高度不确定不是不好，因为高不确定有很大的好处，比如说容易改革，拥抱新生的事物，对fashionable，对时尚的东西会非常的热衷。
The high uncertainty indeed is an important indicator for the openness.,这实际上是我们一种开放性的一个很重要的表现。
"However, since we don't have faith, we lack the rules, models that people can clearly identify.",但是正因为我们没有信仰，很多时候我们缺少规则，我们缺少人们可以明确辨识的模式。
"Sometimes, people don't have a bottom line because people don't know what the bottom line is.",甚至很多时候你没有底线，因为你不知道有什么底线。
"In many cases, the bottom line is defined by faith.",很多时候底线就是信仰为我们划定的。
"In conclusion: Please believe in something, every one!",作为我今天跟大家分享的一个总结：大家相信一点什么吧！
Of course you can believe in the existence of a more positive supernatural power.,当然你可以相信比较正面的超自然力量的存在。
"Also, you can believe in God or other positive supernatural powers.",你可以相信上帝或者相信其它的正面的超自然力量。
"If you really don't believe in anything, you can at least believe that there are devils, ghosts or some powers, which can punish people by frying, cooking or boiling.",如果你实在不信什么，你也可以相信至少魔鬼或者是那个鬼或者是有一些给我们啊煎、炸、烹、煮那种力量是存在的。
"Therefore, we have developed some pursuits and abilities to face the uncertainty in front us.",我们因此而有了一些追求和面对前面不确定的力量。
"Or, due to our fear, we constrain our capricious behaviors.",或者因为我们戒惧，恐惧，所以我们约束自己肆意妄为的行为。
"Either way, they made the theists-ish behave in a more human way.",无论是前者还是后者，它们会使得我们一个多多少少有一点相信超自然的人表现得更像人。
"Because once a person breaks the upper limit or the bottom line, he looks horrible and less human.",因为一个人一旦突破了向上或者向下的界限的时候，人是会很恐怖的，看起来不怎么像人。
"Therefore, faiths can indicate whether we are human or not and which kind of people we are.",所以信仰能够标志出我们是不是人以及是哪一种人。
Thank you all!,谢谢大家，谢谢！
"Hello, everyone!",大家好！
"I am Dai Haisheng, an engineer from Baidu.",我是来自百度的工程师戴海生。
Today I'm going to talk about the second part of the Baidu's voice technologies and their applications.,今天我和大家一起讨论一下百度语音技术应用第二部分。
"There are 4 parts in my presentation: automated speech recognition (ASR), voice wake-up, text-to-speech and voiceprint verification.",那我们今天呢主要包为四个部分：一个部分是回顾一下上一期讲过的语音识别。
The relevant voice technologies and applications of the last 3 parts will be the focus in this video.,另外三个新的部分呢就是关于语音唤醒、声纹确认和语音合成三块相关的语音技术和应用。
Let's begin with a brief review of the ASR and its application.,首先呢我们回顾一下上一期的语音识别应用。
"As I have explained before, ASR means you input a speech into the ASR engine, and then the engine returns a recognition result.",我们说语音识别就是你输入一个语音，到了语音识别引擎，然后它返回给你一个识别结果。
ASR pays more attention to what you have said.,语音识别更关注的呢是说你说了内容是什么。
"There are 2 models built in the engine, namely acoustic model and language model.",然后它在识别引擎里面需要两个模型，一个是声学模型，一个是语言模型。
The 2 models have both gone through some deep neural networks trainings.,它通过一些深度神经网络训练得到的。
Today I will discuss more about the other 3 parts.,今天呢我们主要讲另外三个部分。
The first part is voice wake-up.,其中第一部分呢就是语音唤醒。
In which kinds of scenarios will the voice wake-up technology be applied?,我们说语音唤醒在什么样的场景会用到呢？
Let's review the scenarios in which ASR is used.,我们首先回顾一下语音识别的场景。
ASR will recognize the speech you input and convert it into a text.,在语音识别里面你输入了语音，它就给你一些识别音文本，告诉你说的是什么。
Here we meet a problem when talking to a robot at home.,可是如果我们在家里跟一个机器人儿进行对话，有这样一个问题。
Will the robot be triggered by the conversation between you and your friends?,有时候你的说话并不是跟它说，你是在跟朋友说话，那么它是不是也要响应你呢？
The answer is Yes.,对，如果它一直在监听。
The robot will give some futile responses if it keeps monitoring or communicating.,一直在对话，就给你返回一些无用的结果。
How can we avoid this situation?,那怎么避免这个问题呢？
"One possible way is to manually operate the robot, letting it know the time when a response is required.",一个避免方法是说你通过手动地去点击它、去操控它，让它知道什么时候你开始说话、需要返回结果。
Hence some problems may arise from the manual operation.,这就带来一些操控的麻烦，你就要用手去控制。
So what can we do to deal with this situation?,那我们怎么办呢？
We can also use voice wake-up to trigger the robot.,我们也可以通过语音唤醒的方式来作为开关来触发它。
What is a voice wake-up?,什么是语音唤醒呢？
"You can let the robot know you are calling it by saying ""Xiaodu, Xiaodu"", then the robot will respond ""What can I do for you?""",就像你跟机器人对话，说“小度小度”，噢它知道你叫它了，它就跟你它就可以跟你对话了，说“有什么可以帮您？”。
It is like a conversation between you and your friend.,就像你跟人去跟对话一样。
"Only by being called the name, will the friend in the crowd knows you are talking to him.",你叫了他的名字，他就知道你在跟他说话，不然他一大群人里他也就分不清啦。
"Equipped with voice wake-up, the robot is thus ready to monitor your voice.",所以我们说，当你有了语音唤醒的技术以后，这个机器人它就可以随时在监听你的声音。
On hearing the particular words the robot will be triggered to interact with you.,然后听到唤醒词它就被触发了，给你交互。
"In this way, manual operation and unexpected response can be avoided.",这样你就不用手去触控它，也避免了你在跟别人说话的时候它响应你。
This is the main scenario to apply the voice wake-up.,这就是语音识唤醒的主要应用场景。
Let's move on to the workflow of voice wake-up.,那我们看看语音唤醒的流程。
Most workflows resemble that of ASR very much.,其它流程跟语音识别的流程非常相似。
"You input a speech flow, and the robot sends the identified key words to the engine when feature extraction is completed.",也是输入语音流，然后呢做特征提取，送入送入关键词检出或识别到引擎里面去。
The wake words will be recognized and then scored to indicate how much they resemble each other.,然后它会不仅检出这个唤醒词，并打上一个分数，说它有多大程度相似。
"Furthermore, we will set a threshold value to compare with the score.",在这个基础上，我们看是说这个得分会跟一个阈值去比较。
"The wake word can wake the robot if the score outnumbers the threshold value, say 60, otherwise the word will be abandoned.",如果它高于一定的阈值，比方说大于六十分，我们认为这个可以唤醒；如果低于阈值我们就把它丢弃了。
By setting this threshold value we are capable of controlling the accuracy of wake word.,所以我们可以通过这个阈值的设定，来控制唤醒词唤醒的严格程度。
What are the main indicators of voice wake-up?,那我们说这语音唤醒它有哪些主要指标呢？
"The first is false rejection rate, or FRR.",第一个指标就是错误拒绝率。
What does it mean?,它是关于什么呢？
It means the number of the identification failures when I say the wake word to the robot for 100 times.,就是说我说了一百次的唤醒词，有多少次没有检测检测出来呢。
"The lower the FRR, the better.",对，这个就错误拒绝率越低越好。
"The other indicator is false acceptance rate, or FAR.",同时呢它还有一个值是错误接受率。
What does FAR represent?,错误接受率是什么意思呢？
"It means a word, other than the wake word, triggers a false alarm.",就是说我没有说唤醒词，但是你说话你给我错误地误警了。
"Accordingly, the robot will generate an incorrect response.",错误告诉我检出了。
"Therefore, FAR shall also be lowered as much as possible.",所以这个值呢压得越低越好。
"While the algorithm and model are determined, the two rates can be adjusted based on threshold value.",啊这两个值呢在你的算法和模型一定的情况下，它是受阈值来调节的。
"Power consumption shall be considered, if your device, without external power source, is on and computation is proceeding.",如果你的设备是一个没有外接电源的设备，因为唤唤醒它是一直开着的，一直在计算，所以说就还要考虑设备的功耗。
"For example, if your cellphone is 0.5 to 1m away and you want to operate it via voice wake-up, then you must think about how long will the cell phone battery lasts.",比如说如果你在手机上，手机放在半米到一米远的距离，如果你想应用它，你就要想这个手机它能支持多长时间呢。
So we must lower the power consumption as much as possible.,所以我们就需要把功耗压得比较低。
A relatively higher power consumption may be allowed if external power source is available.,在有外接电源的时候，功耗可以略微放宽一些。
"Next, I'm going to talk about the key factors that shall be taken into account during application design of voice wake-up.",下面讲一下呢这语音唤醒，在设计应用的时候它的主要影响因素。
The first is wake word.,第一个因素就是唤醒词。
"In terms of design, easy-to-remember is the first idea popping up in our minds.",唤醒词的设计呢，首先大家会考虑简单容易记。
"Other factors, say brand effect, shall also be considered.",另外还有一些品牌效应。
We select Xiaodu Xiaodu as the wake word of Robot Xiaodu so as to promote Baidu.,比如说我们的小度机器人儿，它的唤醒词就是小度小度。
The other principle is that the wake word shall be rarely used in our daily life.,另外一个设计的原则呢就是说你在日常用语里面很少用到它。
"If you pick the word ""Xiaoyu"" as the wake word, which is frequently heard in videos, audios or talks between friends, false wake-up may easily occur.",嗯比如果你设计了一个唤醒词，比如说小于，在很多视频里面、音频里面或大家聊天的时候容易用说到这个词，那就更容易被错误地唤醒，所以不是特别好。
The final concern is whether the selected word can easily wake up the robot in terms of the pronounciation.,还有一个呢设计原则就是，你这个词要容易被唤醒，它从发音的角度上。
What can we do to test whether the selected word can easily wake up the robot?,那怎么来测试这个容易被唤醒呢？
"The syllables must conform to some rules, for instance they should have a certain length.",嗯就是你的音节要符合一定的规则，要有一定的长度。
We recommend users upload some easy-to-remember and rarely used wake words to Baidu Voice Cloud.,我们建议呢大家在简单易记的基础上，在日常少用的基础上，把自己的唤醒词上传到百度语音云。
A program there will automatically evaluate the feasibility of this word.,那里有一个自动的程序来帮你评估这个唤醒词是不是可用。
"In addition to the design of wake words, the performance of voice wake-up is also impacted by environment.",除了唤醒词的设计之外呢，语音唤醒的性能还受环境的影响。
"For example, if your device is 0.5 to 1 meter away, the device is in a car, or the voice box is 3 to 5 meters away.",比如说你的设备离你是比较近半米到一米的距离，比如车载的环境；还是说离你比较远，比如说音箱它可以离你有三米到五米的距离。
"Normally, under various environments the voice will inevitably attenuate along the transmission route.",通常在不同的环境底下，然后我们会因为声音在不同的距离上，它是有衰衰减的。
"We will put more efforts to front-end technologies such as microphone array, microphone boost and signal enhancement, since they all have an influence over the quality of the final speech.",我们可能会做前端的麦克风阵列、麦克风增强、信号增强的技术，这些技术都会影响到你最终采集的音频的质量，所以我们要对它特别的关注。
"We still need to notice different environments, such as one full of TV noises or human voices, will also lower the acceptance rate of wake word.",另外一个，在不同的环境底下，比如说周围有播放电视的声音，有啊人声或比较嘈杂，这些环境都会对你的唤醒词的准识别准确率会有影响。
That's why we have to take the environment into account.,所以我们要考虑环境的影响。
Device is another key factor.,另外一个主要影响因素呢就是设备。
"As I have mentioned, we have to filter out noises within different distance, we need to enhance the signal amplitude.",像我们刚才说的，由于我们考虑到了在不同的距离上我们要降噪，我们要增强识音的信号幅度。
So we might develop microphone array at front-end to modulate signal amplitudes.,所以我就做了前端的有可能做麦克风阵列，做信号增强。
"As a matter of fact, while inhibiting the noise, the enhanced signal is also experiencing some changes itself.",它增强以后呢，它确实对噪声有抑制了，它那信号本身它也是有变化的。
So we wonder whether special treatment for different signals is required in the model or algorithm.,所以我们要考虑说对于不同的信号，我们是不是在模型端在算法端有特殊的处理。
Power consumption shall also be considered.,还有一个就是功耗设计。
"For example, power consumption must be in acceptable level if you are trying to use your car-mounted phone via voice wake-up.",比如说对一个设备，例如一个手机，啊在其实在车载的时候，你想通过手机想通过唤醒的方式使用它，我们就需要考虑功耗。
"To achieve this, we must minimize the model size and simplify the algorithm to make things simple, for these impact the final performance of the voice wake-up.",在考虑功耗的时候呢，我们可能就把模型压得尽可能的小，把算法做得尽可能的简单，把复杂度做得简单，所以这些也会影响到你最终的识别唤醒性能。
"Briefly speaking, voice wake-up is a recognition-based technology that enables you to control your device via voice only, making voice interaction a reality.",所以如果我们把语音唤醒总结简单地总结一下，就包括识别语音唤醒，你就不用用手去控制你的设备，让纯粹的语音交互成为了可能。
Our focus varies according to the applications.,另外一个呢我们对于不同的应用。
"For some applications, we focus more on the wake-up rate; for others, we are more concerned by impacts caused by false wake-ups.",可能有些应用我们更关注唤醒率，有些应用我们更关注误唤醒的影响。
"For instance, unexpected wake-up should be avoided at night so we monitor it by setting an appropriate threshold value.",比如说在夜里，我们不希望它被一些突发的噪声吵醒，所以我们通过阈值来调节它的平衡。
"Besides, wake words should be selected according to specific demands of various applications.",还有一个就是我们要根据我们应用的需求来设计唤醒词。
"Consequently, they should be easy to remember, conducive to brand promotion and hard to trigger by mistake.",选一些简单易记、适合品牌露出以及不容易被误触发的唤醒词。
The next part is the application scenario of voiceprint verification.,然后我们下一部分呢就进入了声纹确认的应用场景。
I created a perfect scenario previously in which ASR could be triggered and controlled via voice wake-up.,我们在刚才的场景里面说，我们有语音识别，我们可以通过语音唤醒来触发语音识别、来控制它，但是这都是一个完美的场景。
"But, if we add a TV into that perfect scenario, will a false wake-up be triggered by the voice or wake words from TV?",如果我们边上放了一台电视，电视里不断地放一些音频，那是不是这些音频声音或命令词也可能有时候被误触发呢？
"For example, will the robot be triggered by the wake word ""Xiaodu, Xiaodu"" from someone else in distance?",或者说你听那个命令词唤醒词“小度小度”，如果别人别的人在远处讨论小度小度是不是也会误触发呢？
What can we do to deal with this situation?,那我们怎么解决这个问题呢？
Voiceprint verification is a solution.,我说这个问题我们可以通过声纹确认来解决。
What is voiceprint verification?,它什么意思呢？
Voiceprint verification focuses more on the one who is talking.,声纹确认它更关注的是谁在说话。
The robot will only be triggered if voiceprint verification has verified that you are the one who is actually talking.,如果说只有你说的话，检测出来是你，然后呢才让它触发。
"As you can see from the video, the workflow of voiceprint verification resembles that of voice wake-up very much.",我们也可以看到声纹确认的流确认的流程和语音唤醒流程非常相似。
"Similarly to voice wake-up, voiceprint verification need to score the voiceprint and a voiceprint model library.",只是把其中的语音唤醒的打分变成了声纹打分，把声学模型库变成了声纹模型库。
The voiceprint model library shall be trained independently with other training principles.,但是声纹模型库呢，它是需要独立训练的，它是另外一套训练原则。
Yes.,对。
The model library must be trained by your voice so as to ensure the robot will be triggered only by yourself.,然后既然我要确认是你的语音，我就要采集你的语音过来训练。
"There are also three indicators for the voiceprint verification, including FRR.",我们看声纹确认的指标，它也包为同样的三个部分，一个是错误拒绝率。
It indicates the number of verification failures when I repeat for 100 times.,这就是说当是我说的话说了一百次，你有多少次没有确认对。
The second one is FAR.,另外一个就是错误接受率。
It means the number of false acceptance when I repeat for 100 times.,它不是我说的话说了一百次，你有多少次错误接受了。
Power consumption may be a problem to devices without external power source.,对于类似于没有外接电源的设备呢，你可能会考虑功耗。
Let's look at the application design and factors that should be considered during design of voiceprint verification.,我们看声纹它在设计的时候，应用设计和影响因素有哪些。
"Firstly, a text-related mode may be applied for voiceprint verification.",第一个，我们说声纹的确认，我们可以采用文本相关的模式。
What does a text-related mode mean?,什么叫文本相关的模式呢？
It means fixed phrases can be used as the speech and words for verification.,就是说我们采用固定短语来作为确认的对应的语音和词语。
"What benefit can it generate if we reuse the wake word ""Xiaodu, Xiaodu""?",比如说我们可以复用上面的唤醒词“小度小度”，这有什么好处呢？
The users will no longer be required to memorize another word that has passed voiceprint verification.,就是用户他不用不需要去记另一套声纹确认过相关的词了。
The robot will complete verification and give response when it is waken up by you.,在你唤醒的同时我可以确认，然后并触发。
One benefit is that the text-related mode enables us to complete verification based on a very short speech.,嗯文本相关的一个好处呢，就是说它可以把这个词做得非常短，你在很短的一个语音上就可以确认是不是你。
There is also non-text mode.,嗯相对的还有文本无关的模式。
With this mode the robot can perform voiceprint verification based on any types of texts you use during training or recognition.,就是说你在训练的时候可以说任何文本，同样你在识别的时候也可以说文任何文本，它都可以对您进行确认。
"Limited by the current technology, we must collect a long speech for verification and recognition, for your text is unrelated and uncertain.",在现有的基础下，目前来讲，因为你的文本是无关的、是不确定的，所以就需要对你的确认语音和识别语音采集的比较长。
"In some cases, voice training should last 8 seconds or longer, and the voice for test should last over 3 seconds.",比如说在你的训练语音可能需要八秒甚至更多，然后测试语音可能需要三秒以上。
What methods can be used to collect the users' voice for training and recognition while the users are totally unaware of?,所以呢我们怎么通过一些用户无感知的方案方式采集用户的语音来进行训练和确认？
"As an example, when a customer is calling the bank customer service, the voice of the customer is then available.",嗯比如说一个银行用的例子，在用户给银行客服打电话的时候，通常语音就上来了。
"We will confirm some information, which constitute a speech, with the customer when he/she is calling for the first time.",他第一次打的时候呢，我们要跟他确认一些信息，这些信息就对应他的语音。
"After verification, the speech could be used for training.",这些语音到确认成功以后就可以作为训练语音。
"Then, when the customer is calling again for some information, the voiceprint verification will automatically verify whether the voice really comes from the customer, helping the service staff to evaluate risks.",同样的，当他下一次再打电话进来确认一些问题的时候，后台的语声纹确认就可以自动地确认是不是他的语音，对后台客服人员做一个辅助判断，觉得有没有风险。
A serious predicament of voiceprint is voice imitation.,然后声纹呢它面临一个很大的问题是假冒问题。
Can someone else manage to trigger the robot by imitating your voice?,比如说有人模仿你的话去说模仿你的发音方式去说话，是不是能冒充过去？
"Or, people may record your voice and play it to pass the verification.",还有的一个方案是说，别人会把你的声音录下来，等到需要确认的时候，他把这个声音放出来，他是通过录音的方式假冒你。
Text-to-speech may also be used for imitation.,还可以通过一些语音合成的方式来做一些音频。
What can we do to prevent imitation?,所以我们怎么去做这些事情，防假冒呢？
There are actually some useful options we can resort to.,啊有一些方案。
"One option is robustness, with which we can identify and block the imitated and synthesized voice.",一个方案就是说像我们下面说的，我们要做这个鲁棒性，对一些模仿的声音和合成的声音我们检测出来。
This option will be discussed later.,我们把它蔽掉。
Dynamic text is another option.,另外一个方案呢，就是说可以做一些动态的文本。
It resembles the dynamic code you receive when you make mobile payments.,比如说就像我们在嗯使用在这个手机支付的时候会给你发一些动态码。
This dynamic code varies each time.,这个动态码是每次是变的。
We will verify your identity by sending a dynamic code and checking whether what you say comforms to that code.,那每次呢我除了通过动态码来确认你的声纹，同时我来发现你说的内容和动态码是不是一致。
"Thus, dynamic code is hardly to be recorded in advance or imitated.",对于那样一个动态的声音，然后就很难被实现录音和模仿。
Robustness is related to many other factors.,对，呃我们讲鲁棒性它其实跟很多因素相关。
One factor is environment.,一个是环境的鲁棒性。
The former voiceprint verification performed well in a quiet environment.,在早期的一些声纹基础上，它们在安静的环境底下性能比较好。
But a poor performance was also detected in a noisy environment.,但是一旦声环境变了，声音变得嘈杂了，也变得比较差了。
Device is another factor.,另外呢当你用同一个设备进行录音。
The device used to record voice for training is more suitable for recognition.,它可能录音去训练，同时去识别它可能会比较好。
"Otherwise, the disparity of signal channels between the recording device and recognition device may degrade the voiceprint verification.",但是如果你识别的设备录音的设备识别时的录音设备跟训练时的录音设备有差异的时候，由于信道的作用，差异会导致这个声纹的确认性能下降很多。
"The robustness may also be impacted by ourselves, as the voice might vary with time and our health conditions.",有的时候因为人的因素，因为人在不同的时间，他的声音会变。
We might get hoarse when being ill.,包括他生病了，他的嗓音哑了，他声音也会变，这些都导致了声纹的鲁棒性下降。
There are no efficient solutions available right now.,在当前的情况下呢解决得不是特别好。
"Base on some deep learning solutions, we might have a chance to optimize the robustness of voiceprint verification, if the voice is short enough.",但是现在基于深度学习的方案出来以后，嗯在一些极短的语音的情况下，让声纹确认的鲁棒性提升成为了可能。
"To conclude, for voiceprint recognition and verification, we should explore preferable designs for training based on existing voice or automatic recognition, in an attempt to not bother the customers.",如果我们对声纹识别和确认进行简单地总结来说呢，我们想说，我们在用户训练的时候，我们应该通过设计应用设计尽可能地少打扰用户，让它已有的语音可以用来训练，或者是后台自动的识别。
Special care shall be paid to the robustness of voiceprint itself.,另外一个我们要特别关注声纹的鲁鲁棒性。
"Robustness can be observed in various devices, environments, persons or the varied voice of the same person at different times.",对于不同的设备，不同的环境和说话人的变化，说话人基在不同时间时的嗓音变化，它都具有鲁棒性。
We have also made endeavors to prevent recording and imitation.,我们还要能防止一些录音和假冒。
"Similarly, false alarm rate and success rate shall be considered during voiceprint verification.",此外一样的，我们对声纹确认的时候要考虑它的成功率和误警率。
"Certainly, the focus may change with distinctive application.",在不同的应用底下，可能我关注的重点不一样。
"For example, if we create an account that can only be visited via voiceprint, we might be able to keep the false alarm rate at a very low level while the success rate is kept at acceptable level.",比如如果是一个账号，账号登录，通过声纹来登录，可能我们更关注要误警做得非常非常低，然后做到一定的成功率。
"I have briefed on the ASR, voice wake-up and voiceprint verification.",刚才我们主要介绍了啊语音识别，语音唤醒和声纹确认。
"Those are three technologies all using speeches as the input, while having different recognition target.",它主要都是基于识别模式的，都是输入是语音，出来的呢，对于语音识别来讲，出来的是你说的内容是什么。
"For ASR, the output is the content of our speech; the voice wake-up judges whether the output is a word; the voiceprint verification determines who you are.",对语音唤醒来讲是说说它是不是某一个特定的词；对于声纹来说，你是谁。
"Sometimes after your speech is recognized and processed, the information is not enough so the robot may ask you for more details.",还有另外一个场景，就是说当你的语音识别出来以后做语义理解，有可能它的信息量还不够，机器人需要跟你对话，获取更多的信息量。
"For example, when you say ""Xiaodu, Xiaodu, please book a plane ticket for me"", the robot might asks you for more information, such as the destination, the date and ticket types, etc.",比如说你说“小度小度给我订张机票”，它得到的信息并不是特别完整，它还想知道您要去哪呀，您订哪天的机票呀，您要订什么样的机票呀，还有很多事情要问。
How does it ask you?,那它怎么问呢？
"The robot is programmed to generate a text it will ask via conversation management, later the text will be sent to a speech synthesis module and then be output as a piece of speech.",它就可以通过对话管理生成它要问的文本，这个文本通过语音合成模块，就作为一个语音输出。
That is exactly the technology of speech synthesis that we are going to talk about.,所以这就是我们要讲的语音输合成的技术。
Let's check the workflow of text-to-speech.,我们看一看语音合成的流程。
We have learned that text-to-speech is divided into two types that are concatenative synthesis and rules-based synthesis.,我们说语音合成主要分成两两大类，一大类是基于拼接的，一种在线的合成。
What do the two types stand for?,它什么意思呢？
"In both types, the numerous recorded voice will go through some preliminary treatments, such as text analysis, rhythmic pause and acoustic parameter estimation.",就是说我录了好多好多的语音，在实际处理的时候，它的前处理是一致的，通过文本分析、韵律停顿和声学参数预测。
"When preliminary treatments end, the concatenative synthesis will pick out several segments from those speeches and concatenate them again, if those segments are applicable.",好了之后呢，它就从这些语音里面选，选某一些语音某某几段语音，它们符合要求，然后就把它们拼接起来。
"As for the rules-based synthesis, all the parameters are obtained through speech training.",还有一种呢是基于参数合成的，就是说它所有的参数都是事先通过语音训练好的。
"Once the acoustic parameters are met, speech will be synthesized via a vocoder, rather than by concatenation.",然后将来呢当它达到声学参数以后，它不是把语音拼接起来，而是说通过一个声码器把声音合成出来。
"Here is a speech model training, or synthesis model training, based on deep learning.",啊下面这是一个关于这个基于深度学习的语音模型训练，合成模型训练。
The input here stands for the text to be synthesized.,我们可以看到是说，它的输入是你待合成的文本。
"Under the guidance of recorded voice, the text will be sent to the neutral network for parameter optimization, so as to better match the output voice and existing voice.",它的指导是说你已经录的音，然后通过一些神经网络，然后在神经网络参数这个优化的同时，让你的输出语音和已有语音更match。
"To evaluate the performance of speech synthesis, we would often refer to the output speech, which expresses actually subjective feelings.",那如果我们讲那个语音合成的指标，嗯语音合成它更多的是一个是个语音输出，所以更多的是人的一个主观感受。
There are two ways to measure the performance for the time being.,所以目前呢我们主要是基于两种。
"The first one is MOS, which is given by people who have heard the output speech.",一种是MOS分，就是人听了以后对它进行打分。
"Assume that the highest score is five, which indicates that the quality of the output voice equals to that of an extraordinary broadcaster, then zero is the lowest.",如果假设说最高分是五分，它是说特别优质的播音员的音质，呃最低的就是零分，它就打分给你打多少。
"Commonly, 4 is really high.",一般来讲呢打到四分它已经打得或四分以上已经很高了。
"Current ASR has obtained a very high score in terms of articulation and fluency, reaching 4 or 5.",目前的语音识别在清晰度、流畅度这些方面其实打分已经比较高了，可以打到四或者更高的分数。
The other is ABX expressed as 0/1. What does it mean?,还有一种方案呢我们叫ABX，它是一个零一打分，什么意思呢？
"If there are two text-to-speech engines,",就是有两种声音或者两个语音合成引擎。
Which one is better?,你觉得哪个更好？
"The better one scores 1, and 0 for the other.",对，然后给好的那个去打一分，不好的打零分。
Then we could evaluate the final perfomance generally.,最后综合的评价哪个好。
"In general, scoring the performance is a subjective process so the scores can hardly be quantified objectively.",整体来讲，它是一个主观打分的过程，所以很难对它们进行一个特别客观的量化。
What factors shall be considered in the application design of text-to-speech?,那在语音合成的应用设计里面，它的影响因素有哪些？
"I have introduced previously the two options for text-to-speech, one is concatenation synthesis based on speech library and the other is formant synthesis based on parameters.",我们刚才讲了啊语音合成两种方案，一种是在线的基于音库的拼接方案，还有一种是基于参数的合成方案。
"The rules-based synthesis may suit you better if your device is embedded, you have no access to internet, or you are troubled by data stream.",那如果你是一个嵌入式的设备，如果你很难上网，你或者你考虑流量问题，那可能参数方法就比较适合你。
The text-to-speech can be adjusted to be so small that can be equipped in the device.,你还可以做得比较小，可以做在设备端。
The rules-based synthesis can output speeches of better fluency.,然后啊基于参数合成呢，它的声音的流畅度做得很好，可以非常流利。
"However, since they are not generated by human voice but are purely artificial, these speeches could lack clarity.",但是它的清晰度会差一些，它毕竟是生成的语音，而不是平真人的语音。
The other type enables you to complete cloud-based synthesis.,另外一种呢就是说你可以通过云端合成。
"Used as an enormous speech library, the cloud will transmit a concatenated voice back to you.",云端可以做一个非常非常大的语音库，可以通过拼接的方式来给你返回语音。
"Despite of a poor performance in fluency at the concatenation sites, this method uses real human speeches.",拼接的方式的好处呢就是说它的语音确实是真人说的，它在拼接的地方呢它可能在流畅度上可能会稍有欠缺。
"Reasonably, you are able to employ the most suitable option based on the respective application scenario.",所以在不同应用场景底下可以选择不同的方案。
The other factor related to the text-to-speech is personalization.,另外一个是关于语音合成的设计呢，就是考虑个性化。
Existing robots are not allowed to change their tone. How intriguing it would be if the robot could help tell stories to kids by imitating the tones of the father or mother.,比如说我在家里要给孩子讲故事，现在机器人都是用一个通用的声音来讲，但如果能变成妈妈或者爸爸的声音来讲，那就会有趣的多。
"When you receive a message, it may be more fascinating if the robot could read loud the message in a tone similar to that of the sender.",或者说当你收到一个短信，你需要用语音报出来，如果你能用给你发短信的人的声音报出来，它也会比更有意思一些。
What can we do to make it a reality?,那怎么做到这个呢？
Self-adaptive technology is a necessity.,我们就说我们需要用到一些自适应的技术。
"Once receiving the voice of your mother, we will set out the self-adaptive mode to imitate it.",如果我们拿到妈妈的语音，然后对她的声音进行自适应这个模型自适应。
So that the speech synthesized sounds more like your mother's.,呃你可能做的跟妈妈的声音更像。
Current text-to-speech entails speeches with minimum noises.,但是由于现在当前的啊语音合成。
Most speeches in this technology are recored in recording studios.,它要求的这个输入语音更多的是要求都是比较干净。
"Under the existing algorithm, the text-to-speech may not guarantee a good performacne all the time if the speech is recorded at home.",在录音棚里录出来的，所以说在家庭环境底下录的音可能会稍有欠缺，在当前算法底下，它性能有时候不是特别的好。
What should we do to deal with that?,那怎么办呢？
This is something to be considered during application design.,我们可能在应用设计上需要去考虑这个事情。
"The first step is the selection of basic models, we can build different models.",第一个事情是说基础模型的选择，我们可以做一些不同类型的基础模型。
We can create multiple basic models appropriate to female and male from different areas.,比方说男生的、女生的或不同地域的。
"If the voice sounds like the mother's, a corresponding basic model may be selected for self adaptation, so as to optimize text-to-speech.",那声音本身就跟妈妈可能比较像，选择好的这个基础模型，在这个基础上进行自适应，可能效果会更好一些。
The other solution lies in how to efficiently collect voice data for training.,另外一个我们要考虑怎么更有效地去收集训练语料。
"For example, when someone is texting you, you may have already kept his or her speeches in voice chats or voice calls.",比如说当别人给你发信息的时候，有可能同一个人他可能会给你有一些语音聊天、语音电话。
So will those speech data be collected for training?,这些数据是不是能收集起来，可以用于训练？
We should also try to simplify the work of our users.,还有在应用设计的时候，我们应该降低用户的配合难度。
What does it mean?,这什么意思呢？
Users may not cooperate well with us if they are asked to record a long speech at the beginning.,比如如果我上来就让用户录很长很长的语音，用户看不到效果，他也许就不这么配合。
"But if we select a basic model first to show them the performance of our technology, users will be much more willing to cooperate with us by recording their speeches.",但如果你先选好了基础模型，给他一些效果看，然后让他适量地录一些，看到效果以后用户可能就会更多地配合你来录音。
Sometimes you are also able to record the voice from a mother who is telling stories to children for training purposes.,甚至说妈妈在给孩子讲故事的同时，你可以把这个声音收集下来，将来用于训练。
Better cooperation may be obtained if the user is not intentionally recording for you.,这样他就不是专门为你录音，所以这个就配合度就高多了。
"In conclusion, there are 3 aspects about text-to-speech being elaborated in this video.",那我们对语音合成进行总结的话呢，我们说主要包括三个方面。
The first aspect is to select a suitable synthesis method from the customer-based formant synthesis and server-based concatenative synthesis.,第一个方面是根据一定的需求选择不同的合成方案，是基于客户端的参数合成方案，还是基于服务器端的拼接合成方案。
"Emphasis on personalized scenarios is the second aspect. For instance, speeches can been obtained from scenarios where parents are telling their kids stories.",第二个呢我们要重视一些个性化的场景，比如说家庭里面的用父母的声音给孩子讲故事。
Speeches collected from your phone calls or text messages can also be used.,用来电的人、发短信的人的声音来给你报号码，报短信内容。
We will also endeavor to simplify the cooperation of users via application design.,同时呢我们通过应用设计来降低这个配合难度。
"While reviewing the ASR, we have also gone through 3 new technologies: voice wake-up, voiceprint verification and text-to-speech.",今天呢我们就主要讲介绍了回顾了语音识别，又介绍三种新技术：语音唤醒、声纹确认和语音合成。
"We discussed a lot about application scenarios, workflows and some special tips of those technologies.",我们主要介绍它们的应用场景和应用流程，以及要注意的事项。
"For more details, you can contact us through the following ways.",如果你想了解更多，也可以通过下面的方式联系我们。
I've wished I could walk onto the stage like a model.,其实我今天最想的是踏着猫步走上这个舞台。
"But finally I had to be wheeled up here, and see a world almost one meter lower than I wished for. ",嗯，但是呢，实际上我只能带着我这部轮椅走上来，而且我的视线要低于近乎一米，
That is indeed a regret. ,这确实是有一些遗憾的吧。
"When I was a little girl, I used to care a lot about how I looked. ",嗯我这人哪从小就特别喜欢爱漂亮。
Every mirror I passed could testify that.,凡是啊看到嗯镜子总是不容错过的。
"Not merely mirrors, but anything that can reflect, would make me stay.",不只是镜子，而且是甚至一到了在路面上看到那些反光的地方，我都要流连不已。
I loved dressing up and enjoyed being the center of attention. And I was very sensitive.,我从小就喜欢爱打扮，爱受关注，而且很敏感。
"The performances on the stage, with dry-ice fog and spotlights all around them, would always exhilarate me.",我凡是看到舞台上那些表演的人，那些干冰的烟雾和追光灯我总会激动不已。
 I felt as if I myself were the elf in the spotlight.,好像那个精灵就是我自己。
"What a great thing it would be, I remember I was thinking, to grab people's attention and be adored.",我想哦能让万众瞩目、凝神屏气，是天下最令人陶醉的事了。
"Then two little incidents befell me as a young girl, leaving me some regrets.",当然当时比较小的我，也发生了两件小小的遗憾。
Both were related to the stage.,这两件事都和我的舞台有关。
One incident happened when I was twelve.,有一件事是发生在我十二岁的时候。
"We, our class, were rehearsing a dance named ""A Little Girl Who Is Beachcombing"", for a new-year celebration on the campus. ",那时候我们班级里排练舞蹈《赶海的小姑娘》，参加全校的新年演出，
And I was in the performance team.,我就是表演团队中的一员。
"But one day during the rehearsal, I suddenly found that I could not squat completely down.",在排练的时候啊，我忽然发现我的腿没有办法全部蹲下去了。
And things were soon getting worse. ,而且情况越来越严重。
"Whatever effort I made to rectify, I just couldn't do it. ",我随便怎么调整都没有办法。
Then the teacher saw it. ,然后啊我老师就发现了。
"She tried to help correct my posture, but failed. ",她也帮我纠正了很多回，都没有效果。
"And for the sake of the whole class, I had to be discharged.",最后啊为了顾全大局，我被淘汰了。
"The performance turned out to be a hit, winning a thundering applause.",那天的演出非常精彩，掌声雷动。
"My classmates stood bashfully on the stage, answering their curtain call, while I hid myself in the smothering crowds off the stage, and clapped mechanically.",台上的舞蹈者就是我的同学们，就在羞涩地谢幕的时候，我就躲在黑压压的观众席中，木然地跟着大家一起鼓掌。
Another thing happened when I was seventeen.,还有一件事，是发生在我十七岁的时候。
There was an English sketch comedy competition in our school.,那个时候我们全校去组织一场英语小品表演赛。
Our class planned to act out Maupassant's work The Necklace. ,那个时候我班的参赛作品是莫泊桑的《项链》。
And I was chosen to audition for the heroine—the vain but lovely and honest Madame Mathilde Loisel.,我分配到的角色是嗯那位女主角，就是那个虚荣可爱又诚信的玛蒂尔德。
Each student would have their chance in the preliminary selection.,每个同学都有机会参加初赛。
"When the selection began, I thought I did a great job. ",我觉得我发挥得很出色啊。
"I even imagined myself as Isabelle Adjani, my favorite French actress.",当时我觉得我就在想，我像我当年最喜欢的那个法国女演员伊莎贝尔·阿佳妮那样地在演出。
"There were two judges: the representative of English lesson in our class, and our English teacher. ",评委有两个，英语课代表和老师。
"The representative chose me, but our English teacher just looked at me and said, ""Oh Ding Ming? Forget about it.""",课代表选了我，老师看了我一眼她就说：“哦，丁铭啊，算了吧。”
"There was a reason, for I had already begun to wobble when I walked, though I had not used a wheelchair, like now. ",因为那个时候，我尽管不像现在坐在轮椅上，但是走起路来已经摇摇摆摆。
The teacher might think I would spoil the whole appearance of the class during the performance.,老师觉得我的形象有损于班级的那种表演面貌。
And of course she was right.,她当然是对的咯。
How can the beautiful Mathilde be played by someone who limps?,美丽的玛蒂尔德怎么可能是个跛子呢？
My dream of becoming a performer was thus killed by my illness. ,所以就当时的舞台梦想就被一种病情给扼杀了。
An illness which later revealed itself as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,我当时，后来渐渐地知道了，我得的是那种叫做渐冻人的病症。
It stripped me of the ability to move at my will and to breathe with ease.,它就是能够让我不能够自由地行动，不能轻松地呼吸。
"Within a short time, the things I couldn't hold tightly extended from a basin of water, to a bowl, a telephone and even a cup.",在一个很短暂的时间段里，我的两只手啊从握不起一盆水，到饭碗、电话机、杯子。
"Regrets kept coming unsolicited, for example, when I was wringing out a wet towel, I was supposed to use both hands. ",遗憾不断地产生，就比如说我在搅毛巾的时候，我本来可以两只手一起搅毛巾的。
"But since I had to hold the table for balance, I could spare only one hand for the job.",但是我后来只能一只手，因为另一只手，要扶着桌子保持身体的平衡。
Such regrets went on and on in my life.,那生活中的遗憾就越来越多了。
"At that time I told myself that, it'd be ok if I couldn't become a performer. ",那时候那个舞台的梦想没有实现以后我就在想，我不能上台表演了，没关系啊。
I could make myself a loyal spectator instead.,我可以做一个纯粹的观众。
"Years ago I had a chance to watch Mr. Zhang Jun's exquisite performance as Liu Mengmei, the hero in Tang Xianzu's play ""The Peony Pavilion"".",我曾经在几年前，也在天蟾舞台听过我们张军先生，在表演的那位风神潇洒的柳梦梅。
I had a very good time there off the stage watching it. ,那个时候我在下面，就欣赏得很到位。
"That, I think, might count as a psychic compensation for me.",我就在想这也是对我心灵的一种弥补。
"As time went on, I felt that regrets just came endlessly one after another.",嗯渐渐的我发现啊，其实随着我呃年龄的增长，那遗憾呢一点点它冒了出来，而且越来越多。
"I remember a colleague of mine once joked, ""You've got a most powerful green pass: the disability certificate issued by the People's Republic of China. And you should know that sometimes it is even better at helping you get your own way than an elite university's doctor's degree.""",嗯记得我的同事曾经对我开玩笑说，他说：“哦你哦有一张最牛的绿Pass，这张Pass就是中华人民共和国颁发的残疾证，要知道啊它比任何名牌大学的博士文凭，它有时候还要管用呢。”
That might be true.,我想一想也有可能。
"But for a person like me who always cherishes dreams, the missing diploma is somehow a constant pain.",但是啊学历的缺失对于一个心有追求的人来说，应该是有点苦涩的。
"I remember the first time I encountered a university was when I went to a Qigong presentation, which was supposed to work for my illness, in an auditorium of a university.",我记得我第一次与大学的交集，是去听一场对我治疗有用的气功报告会，在一所大学的礼堂。
It was a quiet night. ,那是一个很宁静的夜晚。
"On my arrival I was greeted with the aroma of foliage, the street lamps, and the light filtering through the windows of the teaching buildings, all feeling beautifully like knowledge.",我就走进校园里，就看到那种草木的清香，还有那种路灯，还有教学楼里发出来的灯光，有一种沁人心脾的书卷气。
All seemed to be summoning a soul that had once missed out on a university—me.,这种书卷气好像在召唤一个学海遗漏的惊魂，就是我。
It remained a pity that I had never become a member of a university.,但是我没有资格成为其中的一员，这是有点遗憾。
But I soon found a way to make up for it—to learn on my own.,但是我又找到一种弥补这个遗憾的方法，就是我自学啊。
"If there was no teacher, no vibe, it wouldn't matter. I would create a vibe by myself.",没关系啊，没老师教，没有大学的氛围，我自己给自己营造一个氛围啊。
Then I threw myself into industrious reading. ,我就手不释卷地在阅读。
"It was easy then, not like today,",当然也是以前的那个时代，不是像现在啦。
when internet might rob us of attention on reading.,因为现在有了网络，可能没有像以前那么专注地去读书了。
For a long time after that I just kept reading and reading.,那个时候我就很长一段时间段里，我就一直在看书，不停地看书。
"I found strength in the books, and became more outgoing. ",渐渐着我在书籍的滋养中我寄托着我自己的一切，而且我变得开朗了。
Books gave me both internal and external nutrition.,变得有一种内外兼修的一种体验。
"A few years ago, my book written based on my own experience, 270,000 characters in length, was published. It was finished within ten months. ",嗯，我曾在几年前出版过一本，以自己成长故事写过的一本书，是27万字的，在十个月之内完成了。
"Without years of experience of reading, I would never have been able to complete the book.",我想如果没有之前十几年的那种阅读的积累，是不可能完成的。
So regrets somehow can also lead to something good.,所以你说遗憾在某种程度上，也造就了一个另外一种状态。
"There is another regret, which occurred later, that I want to talk about.",然后后来有又有一件遗憾。
I was already over twenty years old. ,因为那个时候我到二十几岁的时候嘛。
"Young girls that age always have some romantic pursuits, but in that respect my life was completely blank. ",女孩子无论谁哦都是有一些情感的追求的，但是对于我来说这是一片空白的。
"I remember hearing a girl born in 1989 moan a few days ago, ""Gosh, I am such a left-over woman.""",前一阵子我曾经听一个八九年的女孩子，她说：“哎呦！我已经是剩女了。”
"And I thought, you were born in 1989 and you are already a left-over woman, then where should I—a woman born in 1976—go?",我想你1989年出生的人是剩女了，那你让我一个1976年出生的人情何以堪啊！
"You can understand that, right?",对吧，那个时候我就在想。
"Later I read some articles on the newspaper, which even placed unmarried women into downgrading categories, and each category was mockingly named. ",后来又看到报纸上，有好多什么关于剩女的那些某一种级别，什么黄金剩斗士、斗战剩佛啊，
"I felt bad for myself, for this year is my year of birth and I almost had turned 37.",哎呦我想哦，我现在，今年是我的本命年，我已经是第三个本命年了，虚岁37岁。
"According to their standards, I must be the most pitiable left-over woman, ha-ha-ha.",然后我就在想，哎呦我已经剩到天山童姥的地步啦，哈哈哈。
"So sometimes I will feel a little disturbed, and also lonely.",所以现在又在想，哎呀，这个是不是有时候也挺纠结的，觉得是有一种孤单。
But the plus side of my single life is that I share a strong bond with my parents. ,但是好在，尽管这样子，但是我可以更加完整地生活在我父母的周围。
"I can feel their love for me, and also make them happy. ",我会感受我父母对我的一种关怀，而且我可以承欢膝下。
"Speaking of ""making parents happy"", I feel relieved to find my father absent today, for if he hears this phrase, he must be gripped by bitter memories.",但说到这四个字“承欢膝下”，幸好我父亲今天不在会场上，不然他听到这四个字的时候，他肯定很纠结、很苦涩。
"I was really such a trouble for him, for I was terribly headstrong.",因为我实在给他添了很多很多麻烦，我非常非常的任性啊平时。
"Speaking of my parents, there is one thing I feel especially sorry about: I lack patience with them. ",不过说到父母哦，其实有一点遗憾就是，我平时对我父母是缺乏一点耐心的。
And there is another thing I feel more ashamed about: I often ignore what they do for me.,而且有个最大的遗憾就是，我经常忽视了我父母对自己的付出。
Parental love must be the most touching of all affections.,父母的爱应该是世界上最令人感动的。
Take my father for example.,就拿我父亲来说吧。
Nine years ago he had a kidney removed because of cancer. ,在九年前他因为身患癌症被切除了一只肾脏。
"I still remember that wintry night, when he had just had his operation, I was being wheeled home by an hourly worker.",我记得有一个冬天的傍晚，就是他刚开完刀的时候，我被钟点工推着轮椅回家。
And suddenly I saw an old man wrapped in a down jacket walking up and down before the two iron gates of our community. ,那时候我看到我们家小区门口的两扇铁门的地方，有一个穿着羽绒服的老人在徘徊。
It was my father.,哎呦，原来是我爸爸。
"I asked him, in a blunt manner, ""What are you doing here?""",那个时我还对他不是很礼貌，我说：“哎，我说你这样下来做什么啊？“
"And he said, ""I came down to fetch you home"", with a shy, expecting smile.",然后他就对我说，他说：“我下来等你回家。” 他的笑容中有一种腼腆和期待。
"A lump suddenly came into my throat, for not long before this, his emotional turbulence caused by male menopause had been causing a lot of trouble in the house.",那个时候我的鼻子忽然很酸，因为之前不久，他正好遇上更年期，情绪的动荡给家里带来了很多麻烦。
I had felt that he failed me. ,那时候我觉得我很反感他。
"He was totally not the talented, omnipotent father in my memory.",觉得他完全不是我小时候的眼睛里那个具有才华的、无所不能的父亲了。
"Yet on such a wintry night, this man, completely ignoring the doctor's instructions for him to rest in bed, chose to stand in the icy wind, awaiting his defying, conceited daughter, like an old bird longing for the return of its kids.",但是在一个冬天的傍晚，被医生再三嘱咐过要卧床休息的他，却站在楼下的寒风里等待那个每天与他顶撞的、自命不凡的女儿回家，就像等待倦鸟归巢。
"And I won't forget my mother, who pays me all her attention to discern my feelings, endure my tantrums, and satisfy all my needs, however challenging they are.",还有我的母亲，她用一万个心眼，来观察我的喜怒哀乐，承受我的情绪动荡，满足我的种种苛求。
"I still remember once, about a dozen years ago, I terribly wanted a set of the collected works of Charles Dickens.",我记得在十几年前吧，我想要一套狄更斯文集。
And of course it was not for showing off. I really wanted to read the books.,当然我真要看，不是装逼的那种啊。
"But the bookstore had already sold out all the copies, and there was not an online store to turn to. That was a dozen years ago, you should know.",然后那那那个时候书店里已经没有货了，而且也没有网上购书的，十几年前嘛。
"Then my mother decided to buy the books from the publisher, which was very far away from our house.",我母亲就到出版社去买，离家里很远很远。
"On her way back, she found that the large box containing 19 volumes of Charles Dickens was impossible to carry. ",她实在是挪不动那只大箱子，包着十九卷狄更斯文集的大箱子。
"So she placed the box down on the ground, kicked it, and thus moved it inch by inch, until she got home.",她就把那只箱子放在地上，用脚一点点一点点踢着挪回家去，就是这样子。
"But she told me nothing about it, until several years later, during a TV interview, when the host asked about my habit of reading, she revealed the truth, in a light-hearted and humorous tone.",而且她回来以后什么都没有跟我说，直到在很多年之后我在接受一次电视台的访谈节目，嗯主持人问起我的阅读习惯，她才说了出来，用一种很清淡的幽默的语调。
It was at that moment that I finally realized that parents were the most important part of my life.,那个时候我才意识到了，其实父母才是自己生命当中最重要的。
"I was also thinking that, though I couldn't live my life like a normal person, I still could light up my world with my heart and create wonders that only belong to me.",我还在想，也许哦，我缺乏体验普通人那种惯常的生命历程，但是我可以心用心来温暖自己的世界，成就我的海阔天空。
Regrets are always about loss. ,提到遗憾，遗憾总是与缺失有关。
"However, a truly mature soul should be philosophical about anything he or she owns or loses, and thus feel no regrets.",然而一颗真正成熟的心灵，对于所缺失的以及拥有的任何事物，都应该是通透而无憾的。
"The other day I was staying with some friends. We talked about family background, appearance and wisdom.",就拿最近吧，我和几个朋友在跟我讨论有关于家境、容貌和智慧的话题。
"The three aspects, I guess, are the major causes of regrets for the ordinary people, particularly women.",这三点我想对于普通人，尤其是女性来说，应该是产生遗憾的莫大因素。
"One friend complained to me that she envied those who had high-ranking officials, rich men, stars or any luminaries as parents, for her own parents were really mediocre and could not give her good resources. ",我有一个朋友很痛苦地对我说，她说现代啊都是富二代、官二代、星二代、某二代，她说父母很平庸，她说她只能够没有很好的资源可以辅助她。
"While others had got head starts, she could only trudge her way far behind. ",比如说，别人是从半山腰开始攀登的，而她是用从山底下开始爬的。
"And I said, ""Yours is not so bad actually. Just think, some people might have to climb out of a mountain cave, and some might never have a chance to leave their cellar.""",我说：“你已经挺好了，你要知道嘛，有的人还从山洞里爬出来呢，有的人从地窖里还爬不出来呢。”
What I meant was the sense of satisfaction.,然后这就是一种知足。
"Another friend believed that she looked too plain, and she admired the life of those beautiful ones. ",还有朋友觉得她长得容貌平常，她很羡慕那些具有一副好皮囊的人。
I told her that appearance was actually not so important.,然后我就对她说，其实也没有什么很大的那种关系。
There were also friends who told me their regrets and complaints about not having this or that.,还有一些朋友他经常在遗憾，他没拥有这个没有拥有那个，然后有还还在抱怨。
"Here I'd like to share with you a passage I saw once reposted on the TnDao forum, which approximately denotes that those ascribing their failure to attain or create excellent works to the restraining systems, could not, even if situated in Swiss, liberate their souls.",那么我就在想，我也想跟大家分享一段话，就是我之前在我们《听道》论坛上，我看到的一段转发的一段话。它这句话的大意就是说，那些抱怨着自己在这个体制的捆绑下，没有得到过、创作过优秀作品的人，他就是到了瑞士也没有办法得到灵魂的自由。
"Those blaming marriage for binding them and killing their dreams, could not, even when they are single, become Madame Curie. ",那些埋怨着婚姻束缚着她的理想，磨灭了她的理想状态的人，她就是独身她也成不了居里夫人。
That's it. ,就是这样。
"We are all living in the same age, where hardships and regrets are never uncommon.",我们都是生活在这个时代的当口，我每个人都面临过不少磨难，不少遗憾。
"But when looking out of the window at the world outside, some see the mirror, some see the beautiful scenery beyond, and some only see the darkness lurking there.",但是有的人，我们趴在窗口看这外面的世界，有的人看到的是镜子，有的人看到的是美丽的风景，有个人只是觉得伸手漆黑不见五指。
It is the same with regrets.,遗憾就是如此。
I recall something funny that happened on the bus when I was a kid. And here I'm happy to share it with you.,我又在想我小时候吧，嗯曾经在公交车上发生过一件糗事，这个事情还可以跟大家说一说。
"I was eating a hot, big and tasty Baozi on the bus.",那个时候啊，我正好在公交车上吃一只热腾腾的、大大的、香喷喷的肉包子。
My routine of eating Baozi then was always to leave the best part to the last moment. ,我这人从小有个习惯，就是吃肉包子的时候喜欢把最好的东西留给最后一口。
Can you understand? ,你们知道是什么意思吗？
I mean I would usually eat the skin first and leave the filling inside intact.,就是我光啃着包子的皮，我就舍不得咬那只肉馅儿。
"So I was eating my Baozi, watching the skin gradually peeling off, as I sat there smugly looking at the scenery outside.",我一边啃着包子皮，一边得意洋洋地看着窗外的风景，一层一层地朝后退去。
"The meat filling inside the Baozi was emerging, bigger and bigger in size. I was full of expectation and tried to handle the last bit of skin with care.",这个时候啊，包子的肉馅就露了出来，越来越大，我心里充满着期待，我小心翼翼地转动着包子的皮。
"The holy, crowning moment is coming, I told myself, and be prepared for an extreme satisfaction.",我就在想，马上我就有一种极致的享受啦，神圣的时刻即将到来了。
The bus suddenly stopped short.,急这个时候忽然来了一个急刹车。
The bus driver must be a big bully. ,哦这个司机哦，欺负小孩儿啊。
You should know I was only five or six years old then.,那个时候我才五六岁。
"Then the meat filling of my Baozi just shot away like a ping-pong ball, rolling on the ground for a while and got coated with dust.",我手中的那个包子的肉馅儿就像乒乓球一样地弹出来，然后在地上打了几个滚，沾满了灰尘。
"That wrenched an exclamation out of me, ""Oops! Such a big regret!""",这个时候我就忽然冒出一句话，“哎呦，哪能噶遗憾的啦！”
Passengers on the bus were startled. ,公交车上的其他乘客都吓了。
"They never thought a five-or-six-year-old could use the word ""regret"". ",他们没有想到一个小孩儿，五六岁的学龄前儿童会使用“遗憾”这个词语。
That was also the first time I used the word myself. ,这也是我人生第一次使用“遗憾”。
"Now when I recall this funny experience, I am thinking that, maybe my life looks just like the skin of a Baozi. But that never means it is not a Baozi.",那个时候我就在想，我现在又在回忆起以前的这件糗事，我就在想，其实我的人生也许就是一个包子皮的人生，但是不代表，我性格不包子啊。
Though I indeed missed the meat filling.,哼，我虽然没有吃到过这包子的肉馅。
Regrets are just like that meat filling. What does that mean?,遗憾其实就是我们包子的肉馅儿，怎么解释呢？
"The meat filling symbolizes the regrets and the things implied by the regrets. Though by a stroke of bad luck I couldn't taste the meat filling, but I had already smelled it when I was eating the skin, and tasted it when I was sucking in the meat gravy.",这包子肉馅代表遗憾，以及遗憾所象征的那个事物，我虽然没有最后品尝它，因为一个意外被失去了，但是我在吃包子皮的时候，我已经尝到了肉馅的香气，我在吮吸肉汁的时候，我已经尝到了、感受到了肉馅的鲜美。
"I wonder whether the meat filling, if I really relished it as I intended to, could have given me more satisfaction.",肉馅如果我真的去最后去享用了它，也许也不过如此吧。
So it is with our life. ,我们人生的目的也就是这样。
The process and experience of living might be the most valuable part.,也许那个过程、这个体验更让人觉得珍贵。
There was a bright side in my story. Only when I lost my chance to eat the meat filling could I savor the skin to the utmost.,何况在我没有吃到包子肉馅的前提下，就是这个事实的前提下，我尝到了整个肉皮的这个滋味。
I would never have enjoyed the taste of skin and flavor of flour like that before.,肉皮的滋味，面粉的清香，在我以前是不可以这样足够地尝到了。
That is life.,人生就是这样子。
"As for myself, my regrets are linked with my special physical condition. ",嗯再说因为我的遗憾是因为我的特殊。
"And it is because of my special condition that I have won a lot of attention and support, as well as more tolerance of my waywardness.",也是因为我的特殊我受到了许多关注以及关爱，我的任性会被更多的人所体谅。
I have also received help from different corners of the society.,还有很多社会的力量在资助着我。
"And my ties with TnDao first began because some kind-hearted people and enterprises, who funded a traditional Chinese medicine institution, wanted to do research and treat my illness.",今天可以说一说就是和《听道》的结缘，也是因为一些社会的力量，一些企业，他们就资助着一个中医机构，会让我就是在尝试、研制，让我这个疾病能够克服的一种方案。
"We are still trying, and perhaps one day I can really walk on to this stage like a model.",我们正在尝试中，也许有一天，我真的可以走着猫步踏上这个舞台。
"And if I can't, that'll also be fine.",当然如果不走猫步也没有关系，呵呵。
Why?,因为为什么呢？
"Because I believe, whatever I look like, nothing will stop me smiling my chubby smile and posing gorgeously on this wheelchair.",因为我觉得像我这样的一种形象，我仍然可以带着我满脸的胶原蛋白，然后在这个轮椅上摆出漂亮的Pose。
"Once at school, I lost my chance to perform on the stage. ",尽管我的小时候没有上学校的舞台。
"But today, I manage to speak here on an even larger stage, and share with you my thoughts, my dreams and my strength. I'm in command of the room.",但是我今天上了一个更大的舞台，我可以用我的智慧、我的理想、我的彪悍甚至于我hold住全场。
Eating only the skin of Baozi is not so bad after all.,包子皮的人生并不是没有滋味的。
"But next time I eat a Baozi, I'll try to bite off the meat filling first. Won't it be better to never let regrets happen?",不过我想以后我在吃包子的时候，我一定会先把那个肉馅咬掉，因为这样可以避免遗憾的产生，岂不是更好。
Thank you!,谢谢大家！
"Good afternoon, everyone!",各位朋友，下午好！
"It's a special day of May 4, and I'd like to share with you something special in this special TnDao Talk in Beijing.",在5月4日这样一个不寻常的日子，在北京听道这样一个不寻常的讲坛。
I hope you and many other who love Chinese culture find my talk worthy and thoughtful.,我想跟大家分享一些不寻常的信息，想给在座的诸位，也想给每一个热爱中国文化的人，带来一丝振奋。
"It's about Chinese characters, and the comparison between Chinese characters and the alphabetic writing.",这些信息是关于汉字，关于汉字和字母的对比。
We are all familiar with Chinese characters and the alphabetic writing.,汉字和字母这两个词大家都很熟悉。
They aroused a century-old academic debate among scholars and thinkers in modern China.,但是由它们构成的问题，却引发了中国近代史上最大的一次学术论证，挑战了无数最有智慧的学者和思想家，一百年间悬而未解。
And it's about whether we should discard Chinese characters and replace them with the alphabetic writing.,这个问题就是中国人要不要废弃汉字改用字母。
"There are 3,000 or so languages globally, all being alphabetic based on letters, with Chinese characters as the only exception.",全世界大约有三千多种文字，全部是以字母为基础的拼音文字，汉字是唯一的例外。
"Of the Chinese culture circle, North Korea abandoned Chinese characters; Japan and South Korea only kept a few in use; the Vietnam who has been using Chinese characters for 2,000 years turned to alphabetic writing in 1945.",汉文化圈的几个主要国家，朝鲜弃用汉字，日本和韩国仅仅保留少量少数的汉字，连使用汉字达两千年之久的越南也在1945年废弃汉字转用字母。
"Western academics hold that primitive writing evolved to ideo-phonographic writing and finally to alphabetic writing, the utmost stage of its development.",西方学术界一个普遍的观点是：原始文字经过意音文字进化到字母文字，达到文字发展的最高阶段。
"According to this theory, Chinese characters as ideo-phonographic writing in the lower stage of development should be discarded and will be replaced by Latin alphabet.",按照这种观点，汉字处于意音阶段是低级文字，应该废弃，未来一定会被拉丁字母所取代。
"Against this backdrop, the ferocious contention about Chinese characters and Latin alphabet took place three times over the past century, i.e. the May 4th Movement, early years of the new China, as well as the post-Cultural Revolution Movement.",在这样的背景下，汉字拉丁化的大争鸣在过去一百年发生了三次，分别是五四时期、建国初期和文革之后。
"During the May 4th period, Lu Xun and other advocators of the New Culture Movement saw Chinese characters as the root of cultural backwardness, and strongly supported the idea of abolishing Chinese characters.",五四时期，以鲁迅为代表的新文化运动的倡导者视汉字为中国文化落后的根源，强烈要求废除汉字。
"They were so determined and declared ""If we don't abolish Chinese characters, the whole country will decline and perish"".",甚至说出了“汉字不灭，中国必亡”的宣言。
"However, there are many people who stood on the other side, and oppose to shake or abolish the foundation of the Chinese nation.",但是，也有很多人认为汉字事关中华文明的根基不容动摇。
"Some scholars pointed out that the movement to abolish Chinese characters or replace them with Latin alphabet led by the theory of backward Chinese characters in the last 100 years was unprecedented in its duration, scale, and impact in the Chinese cultural history.",有学者指出，过去一百年在汉字落后论的理论指导之下，以废弃或取代汉字为目标的波澜壮阔的汉字拉丁化运动，其延续时间之长，其规模之大，其影响之深远，在中国文化史上是空前的。
"Unfortunately, Chinese characters are extraordinarily complex, and this grand debate didn't find the answer because there is no answer.",遗憾的是汉字的问题超乎想象的复杂，这场空前的大辩论也没有找到答案，因为没有答案。
"In 2009, Confucius Institute made a large documentary titled The 5,000-Year Chinese Characters, showing the whole world how splendid and grand the language is.",2009年，当孔子学院推出一套大型记录片《汉字五千年》，向全世界宣称汉字的伟大的时候。
"But when asked about the future of Chinese characters, they were hesitative and responded:"" We don't know.""",谈到汉字的明天，他们却只能说，我们谁都不知道。
Because there is no such thing as an answer.,因为没有答案。
"Teachers after teachers lecture our children in learning Chinese language, but none of them could tell them what really is the language; is it really inferior or backward or outdated.",千千万万个老师在教我们的孩子学习中文的时候，没有一个人能告诉我们的孩子中文、汉字到底是一种什么样的文字，这个文字是不是真的低级，是不是真的落后。
Chinese language is the carrier of the Chinese civilization; thus its future development is and will be essential to our nation.,汉字是我们文明的承载体，它的命运如何对于我们的民族是一件大事。
"As for the essence of the Chinese language, we will seek for the answer soon or later.",汉字的本质是什么，迟早需要一个明确的回答。
I am a psychologist.,我是一个心理学家。
"Three years ago, my fellows and I discovered an amazing brain wave in our research.",三年前我们在研究中发现了一个神奇的脑电波。
This brain wave helped us to uncover the mystery of Chinese characters by accident.,这个新的科学发现意外地揭开了汉字之谜。
"My research priority is cognitive neuroscience, the frontier research of psychology, which is exploring the brain mechanism for brain and mental activities via technological means.",我研究的是认知神经科学，是心理学基础研究的最前沿，用先进的技术手段去探索人类大脑活动的人类心理活动的大脑机制。
"Our nerve cells in the brain continuously discharge when we are reading newspaper, listening to lectures or pondering problems.",当人们在看报纸、听演讲或思考问题的时候，大脑内部的神经细胞就会不断地放电。
These electric signals finally reach our scalp and can be recorded through some specialized equipment; this is what brain waves are.,这些电信号传达到头皮之上可以用特殊的仪器记录下来，就是我们说的脑电波。
"In 2008 We found for the first time a negative-going brain wave appeared on top and central of the brain in about 200 milliseconds or 1/5 second when Chinese people are reading Chinese characters, and we called it ""The top and central area N200"".",2008年，我们的研究小组第一次观察到当中国人阅读汉字的时候，在汉字呈现之后两百毫秒左右，也就是说大约五分之一秒的时候，以头的顶部和中部为中心会出现一个负走向的脑电波，我们称之为“顶中区N200”。
"With three years of repeated experiments, we finally confirmed the phenomenon.",经过三年的反复实验，我们确证了这个现象的可靠性。
"The discovery of N200 shows that Chinese characters are not hieroglyphic, as picture symbols would never cause the appearance of N200 brain wave, which means Chinese characters and picture symbols are different things.",N200的发现首先告诉我们汉字它不是一个象形文字，它不是一个象形文字，因为象形文字就是说我们的汉字像图形，但是图形它是从来不会出现N200脑电波的，也就是说我们的汉字跟图形是两类不同的东西。
What continued to surprise us when we consulted plenty of literature and data was that such brain waves never appeared in English words reading.,但是更为奇特的是当我们查阅了大量的文献之后，我们发现，在英文词汇的阅读中从来没有出现过这样一个脑电波。
"When reading English words, at the same span of 200 millisecond, we couldn't find N200.",英文词汇阅读的时候呢，在两百毫秒，两百毫秒这样一个时间段，它完全没有N200的踪迹。
"Astonished, we concluded that this brain wave is specific to  readers of Chinese characters; it stems from years of learning and using this language.",这就导致了一个惊人的结论，我们所发现的这个脑电波是中文特有的，它来源于我们有多年学习和使用汉字的经验。
"Moreover, the N200 has nothing to do with our oral language. It only belongs to our Chinese characters in writing, so there's no N200 when we're listening to Chinese.",另外要强调的是N200和我们的口语是没有关系的，它只属于我们的文字，所以当我们听汉语的时候并不会出现这个脑电波。
"The discovery of N200 is a major breakthrough in Chinese reading mechanism in the past 30 years, and it demonstrates that Chinese characters and the alphabetic writing go through different process in the human brain.",N200的发现是中文阅读脑机制领域三十年研究的一个重大突破，这个现象的出现表明汉字和字母在大脑中经历了完全不同的加工过程。
But why is it exclusive to Chinese characters?,那么为什么中文会有这样一个神奇的脑电波呢？
This brain wave has been proved to be closely related with the recognition of shapes and forms of Chinese characters.,而这个脑电波经过我们的研究证明它是跟汉字的形状识别关系特别密切的。
"Hence the N200 prompted me to dig into the essence of Chinese characters, and with efforts I finally put forward a new ""theory of meaning-based Chinese characters"", declaring its meaning basis for the first time.",所以N200的出现导致我深入地去思考汉字的本质，最后呢提出了一个新的理论叫做“汉字拼义理论”，第一次指出汉字是一个拼义文字。
"To understand the meaning-based writing, one has to know about the phonetic writing.",那么要想理解拼义文字，我们首先来讲一下什么是拼音文字。
"In phonetic writing, bigger phonetic components are formed by smaller ones spelled together.",拼音，就是把小的语音单位拼合到一起形成更大的语音单位。
And the principle behind is actually similar to that of musical notations.,拼音的原理呢，事实上和五线谱是一样的。
"It seems that we use our eyes to read alphabets or musical notations, but if we want to understand musical notations or alphabets, we have to turn to the sounds they symbolize.",我们读字母、读五线谱的时候看起来我们是在用我们的眼睛，但是如果你真正地想理解五线谱，真正地想理解字母的话呢，还是要回到它们所代表的声音上面去。
"Therefore, be it alphabetic or phonetic writing, they are created to record sounds and they are sensitive to the ears.",因此呢，字母文字、拼音文字，事实上它的目的是为了记录声音，它是跟着耳朵走的。
"In this sense, they fall into the category of hearing-based writing.",所以的话呢，它是一种听觉文字。
"However, Chinese characters are meaning-based writing, a completely different category for their structure.",而我们的汉字是拼义文字，它走的是完全另外一条不同的构造道路。
"Chinese people invented about 10,000 individual characters from the time of oracle bone inscriptions to the Eastern Han Dynasty.",从甲骨文到东汉时期，我们大概累计创造了约1万个单字。
Each characther represents a different meaning.,每个单字呢都表示一个不同的意义。
Our ancesters even invented different characters to represent horses in different colors.,乃至于我们一匹马，它的取决于它皮毛颜色的不同，我们的祖先会造就完全不同的字来代表它们。
It's to our knowledge that new things and concepts emerge in endlessly everyday with the advancement of civilization and the progress of society.,但是你可想而知，随着文明的发展随着社会的进步，新事物新概念层出不穷。
"If we just create new characters for new concepts, we would gradually have 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 or more characters, and it would be a burden for us to remember them all.",如果每一个新事物、每一个新概念我们都要造一个新字的话，这个字就会多到1万2万3万4万，那么人还能记得住吗。
"Because the massive quantity is way beyond people's memory capacity, and this kind of writing system would collapse eventually.",这远远超出了人的记忆能力，这样的文字系统它是要崩溃的。
"And just in time our great ancestors found the important principle of meaning-based writing, where they put a horse and a vehicle together and invented a new character denotating a carriage.",在这个时候我们的祖先发现了第二个最重要的原理就是拼义原理，他们把马和车拼到一起形成一个新的词形，来代表马车这样一个新的事物。
"New meaning-based units come from basic meaning units, the opposite to phonetics.",拼义，就是把基本的意义单位拼合起来构成新的意义单位，在这个意义上它跟拼音是针锋相对的。
With meaning-based writing  we don't have to create new characters for new things.,拼义，不需要造新字。
"It relieves us the burden for remembering tons of new characters, and creates limitless possibility for the development of Chinese lexicography.",所以的话呢，它减轻了人的记忆负担，但是却给我们的汉字的词汇发展创造了无穷无尽的空间。
"And most importantly, it turns Chinese characters into a mature and complete writing system.",拼义使得汉字真正地成为一个成熟的完整的文字体系。
Our ancestors knew to form words by combining existing characters.,我们的祖先知道把字和字拼起来可以构成词。
Today we all know it.,今天我们全部都知道。
"But what our ancesters and us did not know is that the process of forming new words from characters is actually works in line with a fundamental princeple in psychology and brain science, which is called the principle of conceptual network.",但是我们的祖先不知道的，连我们自己过去不知道的是，这个用字拼词的拼义过程，事实上它契合了心理学和脑科学一个非常根本的原理，称之为“概念网络原理”。
It means humans' representation of the world is in the form of conceptual network.,也就是说人对世界的表征是以概念网络的形式表征的。
"Here we have nine Chinese characters, meaning beef, pork, mutton, rabbit meat, pig, cattle, sheep, rabbit and meat respectively.",我们看一看中文的词汇，这里有九个词：牛肉、猪肉、羊肉、兔肉，猪、牛、羊、兔和肉。
"Even if you don't understand Chinese characters, you could tell from the word forms that they are somehow connected in a network.",那么即使你不懂中文，从词形你上也可以看到清楚的关系，在这些词汇之间构成了一个网络关系。
And this network could help us understand the meaning of each word and the formation behind them.,而这个网络关系事实上反映了关于涉及的知识。
"But if you just translate these words into English, you couldn't find any connection among their English conterparts.",如果你把这些词翻译成对应的英文，你就会看到英文中的词汇中根本不存在这个关系。
"You see, our ancestors didn't know the meaning-based principle, but they just applied it when forming words unknowingly.",所以，我们的祖先不明白什么是拼义原理，但是他们造词的时候已经在实际地确确实实地在使用这个原理。
Until today we finally find and understand the profound scientific basis of Chinese characters in the field of psychology and brain science.,然而直到今天，从心理学和脑科学出发，我们才真正地捕捉到了真正地认识到了，汉字所具有的深厚的科学基础。
"For meaning-based writing to express and demonstrate the diversified world, it has to have 6,000 to 7,000 basic signals as its minimal and basic meaning units.",拼义文字为了表达丰富的世界，首先要制造六到七千个基本的符号来表达基本的意义单位。
"Due to the limit of human hearing capacity, we have to rely on our vision for meaning-based writing.",那么人的听觉它的能力是非常有限的，所以拼义文字必须要利用视觉。
Vision is superior to hearing in terms of information processiong.,视觉的信息处理能力要远远强于听觉。
"In this point, meaning-based writing has to be vision-based.",所以呢，拼义文字它必然是一个视觉文字。
The recognition of Chinese characters definitely involves complicated and profound visual processing.,汉字的识别必然涉及到非常深刻的视觉加工。
"By now we finally figure out why N200, which reflects visual processing in our brain, only appears in when we read Chinese characters.",到这个地步我们才理解了，哦原来我们的汉字之所以出现N200，出现这样一个反映视觉加工的成分——脑电波。
It's because Chinese characters are indeed vision-based.,是因为我们的文字它就是一个视觉文字。
"Chinese characters and alphabets are two different kinds of writing: one is vision-dependent, and the other hearing-based.",一个是视觉文字，一个是听觉文字，两种文字，汉字和字母本质不同。
"They are not interchangeable, therefore, it's impossible to replace Chinese characters with Latin alphabets.",它是不能相互转换的，所以呢用字母用拉丁字母来取代汉字是永远不可能的。
"With the precise scientific demonstration of the meaning-basis principle, it negates the possibility of replacing Chinese characters with Latin alphabets, finally a solution to the century-old contention.",这样，汉字拼义理论用严密的科学的论证，彻底否定了汉字拉丁化的可能性，解决了这样一个百年争鸣。
"Besides, the meaning-basis principle was accompanied with many interesting new ideas and conclusions.",拼义理论还带来了很多很有趣的新的观念、新的结论。
And I'd like to say something in this regard.,那么我们这里简单说几点。
"First, languages are the foundation and means of human thinking.",首先，语言文字是人类思维的基础和工具。
The vision-based Chinese characters and the hearing-based Western alphabets rely on different senses.,中国人用一个视觉文字，西方人用一个听觉文字，侧重于不同的感官通道。
"Therefore, it is of immense significance to our way of thinking.",大家可想而知这对我们的思维方式的影响是有巨大作用的。
"That's why people say Chinese are good at imaginal or visualized thinking, while westerns abstract and logic thinking.",所以我们说中国人善于形象思维，西方人善于抽象思维、逻辑思维。
It all boils down to the fundamental difference between the two languages.,追根到底可能要归结到我们的文字有很大的不同。
"Second, Vision and hearing are two most important senses for human.",第二点，人最主要的感官就是视觉和听觉。
"Meaning-based writing relies more on vision, and the phonetic writing relies more on hearing.",那么拼义文字它注重视觉，拼音文字注重听觉。
They are the only two types of writing systems and they represent the utmost stage of language development.,它们事实上已经穷尽了人类文字的两种类型，它们都代表了人类文字发展的最高阶段。
"With this, there's no point in saying which one is superior as both Chinese characters and alphabetics have their advantages and disadvantages.",也就是说汉字和字母各有千秋，不存在说谁优谁劣这种问题。
We could say that the principle of meaning-basis helped Chinese characters to stand with the alphabetic writing on an equal footing for the very first time.,这样的话呢，汉字拼义理论就第一次把汉字提升到同字母文字平起平坐的地位。
"And now every Chinese who uses this language is justified to feel proud; every professor who lectures in Chinese is proud to say to his students ""You're learning the greatest language in the world.""",让每一个使用中文的人都有理由为汉字感到自豪，每一个教授中文的老师现在都可以骄傲地告诉学生“你们现在学习的汉字是世界上最优秀的文字。”
"In today's globalized world, we are learning foreign languages, and foreigners are learning Chinese.",在国际化的今天，我们要学外语，外国人也要学中文。
"The meaning-basis principle separates Chinese and English to two different language systems, therefore, those who teach Foreign languages or Chinese could better grasp the fundamental characteristics of the two languages, laying the foundation for science-based and systemic teaching methods.",拼义理论指出中文和英文是两种不同类型的文字体系，所以的话呢从拼义理论出发，外语的教学者、母语的教学者可以更深刻地把握两种文字的本质特点，从而发展出来更为科学、更为系统的教学方法。
"The paper of N200 and the principle of meaning-basis was published in China's top journals in Natural Science and Social Science, and received extensive attention.",N200和拼义理论论文发表在我们国家自然科学和社会科学顶级的学术刊物上，获得学术界的广泛关注。
"Indeed, it's academically-valued, but it shows profound relevance in China today as well, and that's the reason why I want to share something with you here in TnDao.",但是学术之外，它们对于当今中国还有深刻的现实意义，这才是我今天来到“听道”最想跟大家分享的信息。
How about going back into history?,让我们先回顾一点历史。
The ancient Europeans all spoke one common language called primitive Germanic.,古代的欧洲所有的欧洲人讲的是同一种口语，称之为原始日耳曼语。
"As time went by, the language gradually broke down to various dialects, namely the present-day English, German, French and Italy.",随着时间的推移，这一个口语不断地分化，形成了很多种方言，也就是我们今天所说的英语、德语、法语、意大利语。
"When we use alphabets to record different dialects, the final words formed would vary with different pronunciations or spellings.",当我们用字母去记录不同的方言的时候，发音不同，拼写不同，形成的文字也不同。
And this is why even today European countries still couldn't understand better each other in either speaking or writing.,所以欧洲不同的国家现在，在口音上、在文字上都没有办法相互理解。
But the Chinese language is not the case.,汉字不一样。
Different dialects with special pronunciations in this country all use the common Chinse characters for representation.,不同地方的方言虽然有不同的发音，但是我们始终使用同样的一个汉字去表示它。
So we could communicate in the common writing language despite that we may not understand each other in different accents or dialects.,所以口头上不能交流，我们文字上还是可以相互沟通。
And the common national culture is formed.,还是能够形成一个共同的民族文化。
"If we replaced Chinese characters with alphabets, we would probably be broken into parts like today's Europe and never be as one great united country as we do now.",假如中国不用汉字而用了字母，那么恐怕我们像今天的欧洲一样，早就四分五裂，根本没有办法形成一个大统一的宏伟国家。
"Chinese characters made essential contributions to national unification and ethnic unity, and formed the glorious Chinese civilization.",所以汉字对国家的统一和民族的团结起到了根本性的贡献，它铸造了辉煌的中华文明。
It would just do them justice by acknowledging their importance as a symbol for Chinese culture.,它是我们中国文化当之无愧的一个核心标志。
"There're three more things regarded as symbols for Chinese culture, and they are: the centralism, Confucianism and the imperial examination system as well as the modern college entrance examination.",汉字之外，中国文化还有另外三个核心标志，它们分别是：中央集权制、儒家学说、科举制度以及它的后裔高考制度。
"To our knowledge, the four symbols or pillars for Chinese culture all have been challenged.",但是大家都知道，这四个支柱受到了西方文化的强烈震撼。
The centralism was challenged by the parliamentary system and universal suffrage; Confucianism challenged by universal values and morals; the college entrance examination challenged by Western education philosophy of individuality; and Chinese characters by alphabets.,议会制和普选制在挑战我们中央集权的政治模式，普世价值观在挑战我们的儒家学说，强调个性发展的西方教育理念在挑战我们的高考制度，连字母文字也在挑战我们的汉字。
"Indeed, in the historic context of Sino-western civilization collision, Chinese language was deemed as inferior and almost abandoned, an inevitable outcome for the declined Chinese culture since the defeat in the Opium War.",回过头来，在这样一个中西文明大碰撞的历史背景之下，汉字被视为低级文字，并一度走到废弃的边缘，其实是中国人在鸦片战争中败给西方，中国文化沦入低谷的一个必然的结果。
"And the Chinese started to introspect and strive to learn from the West open-mindedly, admiring the advanced military power as well as the political system, technology, education of the West, and finally fell for the Western civilization completely and blindly.",那么打开门户的中国人努力反思自己，拼命地学习西方，从羡慕西方的船坚炮利到羡慕西方的体制、科技、教育，到最后完全拜服于西方的文化。
"Over the past century we found ourselves inferior in any contention or comparison, and we even wanted to abandon our language.",一百年间比来比去我们发觉自己什么都不如，连自己的文字都不如。
"Because we suffered severely in our confidence and pride, and we nearly lost the courage to make creations.",这个时候我们的自信心彻底地坍塌了，跟自信心同时失去的是创造的勇气。
"Admittedly, if a man only looks up to other people's standards, seeing himself as a follower, a laggard, then how could he be courageous and bold enough to create.",一个事事以别人为标准，视自己为落后者、跟随者的人怎么可能有勇气去创造？
"Once you feel unconfident, you lose the courage to create, and lose the ability to create, finally leading to no confidence at all.",没有信心就不敢创造，不敢创造就不能创造，不能创造就越没有信心。
This cruel vicious cycle disheartens and daunts many people in creating the future as it makes us feel unconfident in our culture.,这个残酷的恶性循环使很多人对未来心灰意冷，从最根本的层面上对我们的中国文化失去了信心。
"However, the biggest competition among countries in the 21st century is all about culture, thus we have to re-build our culture if we want to win the competition, without ever repeating the defeat in the Opium War.",然而，二十一世纪国与国之间最大的竞争是文化的竞争，要想在这场竞争中不重蹈鸦片战争的覆辙，我们必须重建自己的文化。
"But to rebuild we need true confidence and pride, which born out of our confirmation and recognition of traditional Chinese culture anew.",真正的重建需要真正的信心，而真正的信心来自于对我们传统文化的价值的重新肯定。
"Or, we have to re-recognize Chinese core values supported by the above-mentioned four pillars for the purpose of national rejuvenation and revival of Chinese culture in the new era.",也就是说为了实现我们中华民族的复兴，我们必须要重新肯定我们中华文明四大支柱的核心价值，让它们在新的时代浴火重生。
And today I ask you to look at Chinese characters.,今天，我们大家先来关注一下汉字这一个支柱。
We have demonstrated through research the scientific foundation and the unique development for Chinese characters.,我们的研究表明汉字是科学的，汉字的发展道路独一无二。
"Hence, even if the whole world is using the same alphabets, we are not giving up our language.",即使全世界的文字都用字母，我们可以不用。
"It's the crystallization of the Chinese civilization, representing the core value of the whole nation, thus we can't replace it with Latin alphabets or have it westernized.",作为中华文明的结晶，汉字不能够拉丁字母化，也就意味着我们民族文化的一个内核，它是不能西化的。
"Chinese characters offer us a powerful example to show that China walks a different path from other countries, western ones included.",所以，汉字给我们提供了一个坚强的例证，那就是中国的道路可以跟所有的国家都不一样，可以跟西方不一致。
And we're powerfully supported to be equal to the West.,汉字给我们一个强力的支撑，让我们有信心同西方文明平起平坐、分庭抗礼。
The restore of confidence is necessary to and symbolic of the rejuvenation of Chinese nation.,自信的回归才是大国振兴的必要条件，才是大国振兴的真正标志。
"The 170 years since the Opium War, a quarter in the 5,000-year civilization, is a mere moment in history.",从鸦片战争到今天的一一百七十年，只不过是五千年文明的一刻钟，历史长河的一瞬间。
"The mountains are still there, but the sunsets have changed.",青山依旧在，几度夕阳红。
"Let us grow confident in our great Chinese characters, transcend temporary victory or defeat, and write a grand new chapter for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with our traditional diligence, wisdom and courage.",让我们从汉字的伟大中汲取自信，超越一时的胜败强弱，以传统的勤劳、智慧与勇敢。
"I believe that as the new generation in the 21st century, we are aspirant enough to dream, to pursue, and to live up to our ancestors.",以新生代的“有梦想”与“敢追求”，去谱写民族复兴的新篇章，证明我们自己无愧于华夏祖先。

At seventy, I could follow the dictates of my own heart; for what I desired no longer overstepped the boundaries of right.""",孔子说过：“我十有五而志于学，三十而立，四十而不惑，五十知天命，六十而耳顺，七十随心所欲、不逾矩。”

"On April 19, President Xi held a symposium on cybersecurity and talked about the need to strengthen the research and development of core technologies and put our products and core technologies into use.",所以4月19号习总书记召开了网络安全的座谈会，讲到了一定要加强我们在核心技术上的研发，让我们的产品，让我们的核心技术能够被大家用。
Only then can we have a chance to improve our present situation.,只有用了才有机会改善我们现在的现状。
He who knows not how to fight knows not how to defend.,未知攻，焉知防。
I’ve spent a little bit of time today talking about some really scary things.,今天我用这个短短的时间给大家讲了前面很可怕的，听起来可能很可很可怕。
I would like to give you some tips.,那么我也讲一点，生活中小小的建议。
"First of all, did you bind credit cards to e-bank?",第一个，各位在座的都在绑信用卡在网银上吧?
"If so, I am sorry to inform you that it is only a matter of time before your card is hacked.",很不幸的通知您只要你绑了，你的这张卡已经不行了，没被盗只是时间问题。
You may be familiar with HTTPS if you use the internet.,我们上网的时候是不是有个HTTPS啊。
The “S” part is closely related to your bank account.,在S的时候是连接我银行的是吧，有印象吗？
"It is for an OppenSSL function, called Secure Socket Layer.",这个S就是加密通道叫OppenSSL。
"The “Heartbleed” bug in 2014 resulted in the theft of databases from many Chinese websites, including a well-known website based in Shanghai.",在2014年“心脏滴血”漏洞造成我们中国很多的网站数据库被盗，包括我们上海每某知名的网站。
Media said that people who had booked hotel or tickets on that website should replace their credit card.,当时媒体就通知，请大家凡是在这个网上订过酒店订过机票的请你更换信用卡。
Why?,为什么？
It’s very simple.,很简单。
"Take a piece of paper and a pen, write down your credit card number and the three-digit check code.",你拿一张纸一支笔，抄下你信用卡的卡号和你后面三位数的校验码。
Take the credit card away.,把这张信用卡收起来。
Can you pay online with this paper?,你拿这张纸你看看你能在网上支付吗?
The answer is yes.,回答是肯定的。
"Of course, you can.",你能支付那一样的。
Many websites record your card number and check code to provide you with convenient services.,因为很多网络过程中，它要给你提供便捷服务，所以都在记录着你这个每一张卡的卡号和你的校验码。
Recently you must hear of the news.,而那个时候，最近你们看到新闻了。
"SMS verification codes are also insecure, or we should say, it is not safe at all.",验证码，所谓的短信验证码并不安全，应该说很不安全。
Here is a tip.,注意。
"If you are binding a credit card to e-bank, choose one with lower quota to reduce the risk.",大家如果再要用卡绑在你的手机网银上的时候，小窍门儿，绑一张低额的信用卡让你在被盗的时候降低风险。
"In fact, cybersecurity work is to reduce the risk, because risks can never be eliminated.",其实网络安全本身就是降低风险，是不是，因为安全无绝对。
"In addition, I believe that many of you are using your credit card on POS terminals.",第二个，各位你们都用信用卡去刷pos机。
I suggest you cancel the password you use on POS terminal consumption.,听完我的这个小小的演讲，取消你在pos机消费时的密码。
"People may ask, “Isn’t it unsafe not to have a password?”",很多人问，没有密码不是不安全吗？
I think people who have a credit card usually have a Visa or Master card as well.,我想各位有信用卡的人一定有国外的visa或者master的卡。
"If you have spent some time or bought things abroad, you will find that you are only required to enter your password when swiping a UnionPay card.",你们也一定在国外呆过，或者消费过，你会发现一件事儿，如果你刷银联卡，它就叫你输入密码。
"Visa or Master card consumption does not require a password, is it right?",如果你说刷的是visa或者master你不用输入密码，是不是啊？

"And thirdly, everybody is using cell phone.",好，第三个，很多人用手机吧。
Many have two.,很多人拥有两个手机。
Let me tell you the right way to use two phones at the same time.,我可以告诉大家两个手机正确的使用方法。
I'm not talking about two internet-connected phones that handle work and personal affairs separately.,不是你们现在用的，两个手机都能上网，两个手机都能打电话，因为为了工作方便一个私人的一个工作的或者等等。
You can use one phone to surf the internet.,其实一个手机上网。

"As long as your phone is connected to the internet, it can’t keep secrets.",所以只要你的手机在联网状态下你没有秘密，你存不住东西。
These three tips are to let you know that cybersecurity is a contradiction.,我送这三个小小的提示，是为了让大家知道网络安全就是矛和盾的关系。
"There is no absolute safety, and there is no absolute safe technology.",没有绝对安全，所以也没有绝对安全的技术。
Technology is always ancillary.,技术永远是辅助。
Don’t assume that antivirus software will keep your computer safe.,您不要认为你装了杀毒软件，你的电脑万无一失。
It’s like the human body.,就好比人的身体。
"Which appeared first, vaccines or viruses?",你生病的时候是先有疫苗还是先有病毒啊？
"Therefore, technology can only be an aid.",所以技术只能作为辅助。
Promoting cybersecurity requires raising the security awareness of the whole nation.,真正的提高网络安全保障自己的网安全，就是提高全民的安全意识。
"I am hoping that you can pass this to more people around you, especially the elderly.",大家希望听过这个课，能够给大家身边的人特别是老人多宣传一下。
"No matter who you are, no matter it is text message or WeChat message, do not click on an unconfirmed link.",送一个很重要的就是告诉所有身边的人，无论是谁，不管是短信，微信，给你发任何的信息，只要有链接在你没确认之下不要点。
Just don't.,千万不要点。

"If Trojan Horse virus is on your phone, the credit card number and password you enter will be sent to the hacker.",而当时中了木马以后，你的手机里边输入信用卡号、输入密码的时候都会无形地向黑客服发送。
"After the Eighteenth National Congress of the CPC, President Xi has said: “Without cybersecurity, there is no national security. Without informationization, there will be no modernization.”",十八大以来，我们总书记说了：“没有网络安全就没有国家安全，没有信息化就没有现代化。”
Cybersecurity is the foundation.,网络安全是放在前面的，网络安全是地基产业。
Only by consolidating cybersecurity can the infinite prospect of internet development be realized.,只有在网络安全建立的巩固的情况下，我们的互联网发展才前景无限。
The road ahead is long.,路漫漫其修远兮，我们的路还很长。
"We will and we have to embrace the internet, but we have to be vigilant all the time, too.",因为我们要拥抱网络，我们必须拥抱网络，但是我们时时要敲响这个警钟。
"You can use the internet, but you need to be careful.",让大家知道网络要用它，要用好它，同时你要有时时提醒自己的那一份心。
"Remember, your data is also your property.",不要忘了，你的数据也是你的财产。
Thank you!,谢谢大家！
I've just finished my work as the supporting male of the soap opera Spring in the Office.,刚刚完成了，电视连续剧《办公室的春天》的拍摄工作，我出任的是男二号的角色。
I heard that many made fun of me for not being good-looking enough to act.,很多人说唐骏就你这个长相还去演电视剧。
"Let me make it clear. The director would like an instinctive actor as the president of a company in the opera, so they searched online ""The top ten handsome presidents in China"".",因为剧组他们想找一位本色的演员，出任一位总裁，所以他们在网上搜了一下，叫做“中国十大帅哥总裁”。
"I don't know how I stood out in the appraisal, but you won't believe who those candidates were.",他们不知道怎么评出来的，但是你知道吗，都是什么样的人在参加评选呢。
How could I not be chosen among people like Jack Ma and Shi Yuzhu?,什么马云啊，什么史玉柱啊，哎，你们说我我们二十个人站在台上，还需要评吗？
This reminds me of a famous saying by Jack Ma — A man of wisdom is often not good-looking.,当然，马云有一个经典的名言，他说：“男人的智慧和长相通常是成反比的。”
Don't you think he is a perfect example of this saying?,哎我觉得这句话太适合他啦，意思你懂的？
I personally think him as the most intelligent of our kind.,因为他是我们周围企业家当中我觉得是最具智慧的那么一个男人。
"Well, let's go down to the business. I'm here today to share with you the lessons I learnt from my past life.",其实今天来我想跟大家一起来分享我的人生的一些感悟。
What is life?,什么是人生？
"As for me, it is a journey.",其实，人生就是一个旅途。
"A journey always has its destination, and all humans share a common one, whether you choose it or not, it is waiting for you at the end of life.",既然是旅途，就会有终点，而且有意思的是我们全人类的终点都是一样的，你选择它，不选择它，我们都得到那个终点。
"When reaching the destination, the greater ones can have their portraits on the wall,",当你到达终点以后，伟大一点，就是挂在墙上。
"In China, places are limited, most of which have already been taken.",在中国，挂在墙上的名额是有限制的，而且名额已经被占了。
"So, when you become aware of that, you really don’t need to pursue it, for you can't avoid it anyway.",所以，我觉得当你想到这样的结果的时候，你真的不用去追求，你也绕不过它。
"Well then, what is the most important thing in life?",所以人生什么最重要？
I believe it's the process.,我觉得是它的过程。
"Since it is a process, there will be laughs, tears as well as storms.",既然是人生的过程，我们说有欢笑，有哭泣，当然也有风雨。
We always hear that a life without hardships would be incomplete.,书上说，说“一个人没有经过风雨的人生是不完整的。”
"From this point, I reckon my life to be more complete than any one of you.",我觉得在这个意义上来说我唐骏肯定比在座的每一位的人生都要完整得多得多。
You know what I mean.,意思你懂的。
"Back in 1990, 24 years ago, I was a post graduate student pursuing a degree at the Nagoya University.",我们看整个的时光，我把时光倒流到24年前的1990年，那个时候唐骏是日本名古屋大学的一位研究生，在攻读他那个学位。

"At a regular result presentation, my supervisor Itakura Fumitada was not pleased with my work and said, ""Maybe you can write a paper with such a result back in your country, but it's not possible in Japan.""",在一次的例行的研究成果发表会上，我的导师板仓文忠对我真的非常地不满，最后他居然用了这么一句话，他说：“唐骏你这个研究成果拿回你中国也许可以把它变成一篇论文，但是在日本是不可能的。”
"Hearing this, I felt a sting in my vulnerable heart.",你想想，当时一个弱小的我，那种心灵受到的那种刺伤的那种感觉。

"My answer was no, not because that choice led me to Microsoft and made me who I am today.",我没有后悔，并不是说因为，我的那次的选择，让我走进了微软，让我有了今天。
"If I had not done so, Itakura Fumitada would never have said that I was the best of his students 20 years later; If I had not done so, the president of the Nagoya University would never have told me that I was a distinguished student of the university.",不是那么一摔，20年后那个板仓文忠居然和我说我是他最优秀的学生，不是那一摔，名古屋大学的校长跟我说，我是名古屋大学的杰出校友。
That choice mattered because it preserved a little of my dignity and made me more self-assured before them.,我觉得，我觉得那次的选择是什么，让我有了那么一点点的尊严，让我在他们面前有了那么一点点的骨气。
"Later on, to make up for this, I took an on-job postgraduate degree in a third-rate university in America.",为了弥补这么一个缺憾，我在美国，读了一个九流的所谓的在职研究生。

"""No, it's a mutual need"" I insisted.",“不是的，是双方的需求。”
"Gates finally accepted my opinion and became willing to provide this function only to the Chinese market, with a condition, though.",最后，盖茨接受了我的想法，愿意为中国这个市场单独增加这一个功能，但是有一个条件。
The Microsoft China must promise that MSN would gain 1.5 million dollars of income from advertising in three years to compensate the expenses in development and maintenance.,说微软中国公司要承诺，承诺未来的三年，在MSN上要获得150万美金的广告用来弥补开发和维护的费用。

"I think that's why people say that the delight of life lies in infinite choices, for you can't foresee the consequences.",所以我们说，人生的精彩在于什么，就是在于不断地在选择，因为你不知道结果。
Some asked me what the biggest lesson I learnt from all my experiences.,很多人也会说唐骏，你经历了那么多，你的最大的感悟是什么。
The answer was to have the courage to make choices.,我觉得我就是在敢于做选择。
Another question is how I made it through in my most difficult times when I encountered hardships.,也有人问说，你的人生在你遇到最困难的时候，遇到挫折的时候，你是怎么走过来的。

"After that trip, after cycling through a dozen more countries,  after reading over 100 books about bicycles,  when visiting the coolest bicycle shop in town wherever I go, when making friends with bicycle lovers from around the world, and when the images of bicycle were shown on my buttons, socks, book-ends and discs, I clearly felt my love for bicycles.",在那一次之后，在我一个人骑过十几个国家之后，在我看过一百多本关于自行车的书之后，在我每到一个城市都去探访那些最酷的自行车店的时候，当我跟全世界的自行车的爱好者交朋友的时候，当我的袖扣、当我的袜子、当我的书立、当我的唱片全部变成自行车的时候，我知道我爱这个东西。
My just published book is also about bicycles.,我写的那本书也是关于自行车的。
"As an amateur writer, I am sorry for not having focused on something grander and greater.",对不起，这个业余作家不太称职吧，应该写点更宏大的东西哦。
I just took down my inspirations from bicycles.,可是我只写了关于自行车给我的那些启发。

The second thing I learnt form it is acceptance.,那我再跟大家分享第二个，那就是接受。

A sudden rain is the most terrible thing in long-distance cycling trips.,你知道骑长途的时候最怕的一件事情就是下雨。
What else?,还有一件事情是什么？
Roadside breakdown.,车坏、抛锚。
Anything more?,还有一件事情是什么？
Navigation failure.,导航。
Getting lost.,的迷路。
Are you puzzled by the last one?,那最后一件事情你们是不是会觉得纳闷儿？
"With a mobile phone in hand, how can one get lost?",有手机还会迷路吗？
"In my early days of cycling, mobile navigation wasn’t that accurate.",但我们最早骑车的时候，那时候手机导航能力还很弱的。
"That day, I was lucky enough to encounter three of them once for all.",可是我那天我运气特别好，三件事情都遇见了。
"I was blindly riding on my bicycle, not knowing which direction to go.",当我在那个路上，很仓皇地跑来跑去骑来骑去找不到一个应该走的那个方向的时候。
"My map got wet in the rain, and I could not see it clearly.",地图都被雨水打湿了，看不清楚。

My original intention was to ask him the way.,我本来过去找他问道的。
"But when I approached him, I couldn’t help asking, “Sir, why do you keep hunting in the rain? ”",可是我忍不住先问了他一句，我说：“先生，这不是在下雨吗？你还打猎。”
"He looked at me and said, “Lad, who said only sunny day is nice and rainy day isn’t?”",他就看着我也说：“年轻人，难道晴天是好天气，雨天就不是吗？”
His words were what touched me most in the cycling trip.,就这是骑行过程里边对我最触动最大的一件事情。
You know what?,所以你知道吗？
My last long-distance journey was to Argentina.,我最后一次骑五大洲的长途是去阿根廷。

No laughter.,你们听了不笑。
It seems you guys have never been to the Southern Hemisphere.,看来你们就没去过南半球。
Haha.,呵呵，呵呵。
"During that trip, every day, except one sunny day, I set off in the rain and reached a destination in the rain.",我那一次骑行每一天都是在雨里边出发，每一天都在雨里边到达目的地，只有一天是晴天。
"Yet, this did not prevent me from enjoying the enchanting view of Argentina.",可是一点都不妨碍我去欣赏阿根廷的美景。
It was as fantastic and beautiful as described in Borges’ novels.,真的就像博尔赫斯的那种，小说里边写的那种感受一样，非常的魔幻、非常的美。
I could appreciate the beauty because I learnt that “sunny day is nice; so is rainy day.”,对，因为我记得那句话，他跟我讲晴天是好天气，雨天也是。
"Indeed, what I saw in the rain along the way in the lake region in south Argentina was a dream-like wonderland.",我相信呢那些我在雨里边走骑过的阿根廷南部的湖区的路线，真的像梦幻一般。
And there’s no way one can experience it in sunny days.,不会有人在晴天里边遇到那样有那样的感受，看到那样的美景，不会。
Life is unpredictable.,人生是变化无常。
How can you expect it to be a barrier-free one?,你怎么能期望你的人生永远是顺风顺道呢？
No way.,不可能的。

But I failed at the startup stage.,可是我创业失败了。
The worst of all was that no one even knew you failed.,而且失败的时候多可怕你知道吗？都没有人知道你失败了。
You guys are laughing. So uncompassionate!,你看你们这些没有同情心的，还笑！
There is a lot more that I learnt from cycling.,骑车还教会我更多啦。
"When I was on a cycling trip, I often thought about such things as death can happen to anyone anytime.",我觉得就当我在骑路上的时候我经常会想自己这些问题，就是对于一个人来讲，一个人生来讲，死亡也是你不知道它什么时候发生。
That’s beyond our control just like we cannot decide whether to come to this world.,就像我们来这个世上不是自己主动决定的一样。
No one can predict that.,这些东西没有谁可以预料。
Life is so unpredictable.,生活就是这么无常。
"When you think about that, life becomes so void and meaningless.",尤其有时候想想，超非常非常的虚无。
"For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. The in-between period is too short to be wasted on the trivial.",你从人生从零到零这个过程里边有一些东西真的是不重要的。
One needs to find some reason to love this elusive world and makes it meaningful.,但恰恰因为从零到零是这么的这么的虚无，你却要去找一点理由让自己能够爱这个世界。
What else would I like to share with you?,我还想跟大家分享的一点，是什么来着啊？

I am happy that at a critical stage of my life I at least had such a reflection and that I could spend time on what I truly loved.,我很开心啦，能够最后在人生一个重要的一个关键点里边，我愿意说我想起码我这个那个时间点上我想到了这件事情，我愿意把我的时间花给我让我给我带来真心快乐的一件事情。
"If I have to answer that question I raised in the beginning, I’d say the winner of life is someone who finds and does something that makes him or her really happy.",如果说现在对我来讲我觉得非要给出一个答案的话，我会是说人生的最最重要的胜利，那就是让你得到发自内心的快乐。
"I remember a poet once said in his later years, “To think that once I was the same man did not embarrass me. ”",曾经有一个诗人在他晚年的时候这样说，他说：想到故我今我同为一人，并不让我感到羞愧。
"Yes, it was said by Czeslaw Milosz in his later years.",这是他老年的时候写的，米沃什写的。
I regard it as an important yardstick for my life wisdom.,我是觉得这可能是人衡量人生标准的一个非常重重要的一个智慧的一个标准吧。
What can be controlled now that life is essentially unpredictable?,我们一路走过来，那些结果既然不可预测，但是我们可掌控的是什么？
It is what we should spend our short life-time on.,就是我们用什么东西去走过这一段儿，这一段其实很短。

Let's start by a story.,嗯，先给大家讲一个故事吧。
"About 10 years ago, I was invited to a prestigious hospital in Beijing to give a lecture to mothers among medical staff on early childhood education.",大概在10年前，呃我在北京呢应邀去一家儿大医院给医护人员中的妈妈们举办一场关于早教的讲座。
"After the lecture, several mothers came to consult me in line about breast-feeding.",讲座完了之后有几个妈妈还来找我咨询母乳喂养的问题。
"After we all finished discussions, they just sat aside and chatted.",我们都说完话以后，她们几个就坐在一边儿聊天儿。
"At that time, a mother who was at the end of the line, slipped towards me to consult in a very low voice about her daughter's personality problem.",这个时候只见排在最后边儿的一个妈妈，悄悄儿地溜过来，非常小声儿地向我咨询她女儿的性格问题。
"According to her, the 5-year-old girl was particularly introverted.",她说她5岁的女儿特别地内向。
"For example, in kindergarten, she was never a volunteer to raise hands.",比如在幼儿园里边儿从来不主动举手、发言。
"Moreover, when they went out and met their neighbors or acquaintances, she would not greet actively or just ignore them and their questions.",出门在外碰上邻居熟人也不叫人、不打招呼，人家问她什么问题，她也不理人家。
"When there were guests at home, she also refused to give a show anyway.",家里来了个人说给表演个节目吧，这孩子死活不肯。
Her mother was so worried that she asked me what to do.,她妈妈就特别地担心，问我怎么办。
"Then I looked around and said, “Well, here are all your acquaintances, just five or six colleagues you know very well, could you please sing a song to us?”",我当时左右看了看就说：“诶，咱们这儿也没外人，就五六个你很熟悉的同事，你给我们大家唱首歌儿？”
"She was stunned at first, and then smiled with great embarrassment.",这妈妈先是一愣，然后就特别不好意思笑着。
"Thus I said, “Look, how can you ask a child to do something you cannot do?”",我说：“你看，你都办不到的事情怎么能够要求孩子办到呢？”
"After that, as I have witnessed so many similar cases, what once seemed bewildering will no longer be so.",后来这种案例见多了我也就百炼成巫了。
"As long as parents came to me to complain about their children’s faults, usually including being introversive, cowardly, timid, impressible, not graceful, not optimistic, not lively, unsociable, aggressive, disobedient, stubborn, snack-addicted, hyperactive, distractible or not interested in sport, I always asked such a question: “Does there anybody in your family have the same qualities?”",但凡有家长过来找我控诉他们家孩子的罪状，比如说最常见的就是孩子内向、懦弱、胆怯、敏感、不大方、不开朗、不活泼、不合群儿，还有暴力、不听话、执拗、呃爱吃零食、好动、不专注、不爱运动等等等等，我一般就问这么一句：“你们家谁这样儿啊？”
The mere response was always an embarrassed smile.,这么一问，对方一般就嘿嘿嘿嘿嘿嘿嘿，就笑起来了。
More words then were not necessary as those people knew the answer clearly.,我就不用多说什么了，人心里明白着呢。
"However, some might be reluctant to admit the facts and replied that “Nobody in my family behaves in that way. How unlucky to have such an awkward child!”",但是也有嘴硬的，“我们家没人这样儿啊，就这么寸！我们就生了一个隔塞的孩子。”
I just showed amiable smile without words and looked directly at them.,我还是不用多说什么就面带慈祥的笑容再多看他们两眼。
After a while they would also smiled embarrassedly.,过一会儿他们也就嘿嘿嘿嘿嘿笑起来了。
"Or furthermore, some still denied and attributed all the faults to their elder generations such as grandpas and grandmas.",但是还有嘴硬的，把屎盆子扣他们家老人身上，“哦，我们家奶奶孩子奶奶就这样或者姥姥姥爷爷爷之类的。
In no way would they admit their own deficiencies and others should be blamed.,啊就这样，死活不肯承认错误，什么事儿都不是他的错儿都是别人的错儿。”
How unfair it is!,瞧瞧老人多冤啊！
The elder generations who voluntarily took care of grandsons or granddaughters but simply received complaints.,义务帮人带了孩子还不落好儿。
And they even could not defend themselves due to absence.,也不在场也没法儿给自己申辩。
Why?,为什么呢？
"Because I found a secret, that is, children are born to grow and study through the most important way, imitation.",因为我掌握了一个秘密，那就是儿童来到这个地球上，他们成长和学习的最重要的方式就是模仿。
"This is not a new idea, but instead has long been agreed in the academic circles.",这个不是什么新鲜的理念，这个在学界早已经有了共识。
"However, the physiological explanations of this phenomenon were clarified in the mid-1990s by a group of Italian scientists.",但是对这一个现象的生理性的解释却是最近，就是上个世纪90年代中期由一群意大利科学家发现的。
They found that  in the premotor cortex of our brain were some special neurons.,他们发现在我们脑的前运动皮层里边有那么一组非常特殊的神经细胞。
"When we saw someone doing something, these neurons became active, as if we were doing the same things by ourselves.",就当我们看到别人在做什么事情的时候儿，这组神经细胞就活跃起来了，好像自己也在做这件事情。
So scientists have named them as “mirror neurons”.,科学家们就把这组神经细胞命名为“镜像神经元”。
“Mirror” refers to something that can reflect other things in our daily life.,就是“镜子”的“镜”。
Relevant researches have been a hot topic in recent 20 years and yielded fruitful results.,镜像神经元的研究呢，就是最近这20来年一直都很火，科学家们有了很多很多的发现。
Then back to the story of the nurse mother I mentioned.,那么再回到刚才那位护士妈妈。
"She asked me: “My daughter’s case that she will not greet actively or just ignore others really embarrassed me, could you please give me some advice?”",当时她就问我：“那您说了我这闺女就她出门儿在外人家跟她打招呼她也不理，你说我这多没面子呀，你说该怎么办？”
"Hence I replied, “Have you ever set a model for her to imitate?”",我当时就跟她说，我说：“那你有没有给人家提供一个可以模仿的样本呢？”
"The mother said, “I think she’s already five years old and should be mature enough without our guidance.”",这妈妈说：“我觉得她都5岁了就这么大了应该懂事儿了，不用我们多嘴了。”
"I added, “If you don’t teach and influence her by your word and deed, no matter how old she is, it’s impossible for her to teach herself how to deal with the relationship with others.If you cannot offer a model to imitate, but just expect your child to be more optimistic, graceful and polite, moreover, criticize her otherwise, it’s not fair indeed.”",那我说：“那那您这儿不不以身作则，言传身教，你孩子长多大也不可能突然有一天无师自通就知道怎么跟人打交道了。那么你不给孩子提供一个可以模仿的样本，你只是期待她开朗、大方、懂礼貌，不然的话你就批评人家，这个是不公平的。”
There was nothing wrong with my advice to this mother.,我给这妈妈的忠告是没有错儿的。
"But ten years later, it seemed to be a very superficial proposal.",但是十年之后看一看，它是一个很肤浅的一种提议。
"Because according to studies of mirror neurons and children’s psychological development, children do not imitate others mechanically, or specifically, actions of adults.",因为对镜像神经元的研究以及对儿童心理发展的研究都发现孩子不是仅仅模仿机械地模仿别人的动作，成年人的动作。
"Instead, they have a special ability to sensitively capture others’ intentions and corresponding consequences, which are the two sources of their imitation.",而是他们有一种特殊的本领，他们能够敏感地捕捉到别人的意图和行为的后果，对这两样东西加以模仿。
"What’s more, babies who were born just two days ago have already endowed with superpower to figure out cries out of or without real emotions.",科学家们也发现就是刚才说的刚出生才两天的小宝宝，他们已经具备一种超超能力就是能够分辨出什么是真哭，什么是假哭。
"Only after identifying real cries from other babies, they will follow to cry.",只有当他们听到真的孩子在哭的时候，他们也才跟着哭起来。
"It is hard to understand, especially for parents, that children not only imitate your actions, but also your inner voice.",这一点，比较难让别人理解，尤其家长们，就是说孩子不是是只是模仿你的行为而是模仿你的内心。
A difficult point indeed.,比较让他们难以理解。
Why?,因为什么？
Because we have accustomed to bury our inner voice deeply and put on the “masks” that are recognized by others or the society.,我们早已经习惯了，把自己内心真实的感受隐藏起来，戴着一副面具，而且是别人或者社会认可的这个面具来生活。
"Mostly, we are confused, numb or not sure about our true hearts.",大部分时间我们自己都糊涂了，混淆了，麻木了，搞不清楚哪一个是我们真实的感受。
But children have such magic to read your minds and use their power to destroy our perfect “masks”.,但是孩子是有魔力的，每一个孩子都会读心术，他们都能够用他们的小手儿在我们完美的面具上戳几个窟窿。
"Here is another simple case, also the most common one.",举一个最简单的例子，最常见的啊。
"In the morning, mothers send their children to the kindergarten.",早上起来妈妈把孩子送幼儿园去。
"Especially in September every year, namely a start of a new school year, we always see children resisting to let mothers go, seeming to cry in deep grieve and with great noise.",尤其是每年9月份幼儿园刚刚开始一个新学年的时候儿，妈妈要跟孩子告别，孩子不让妈走，哭得这叫一个撕心裂肺，哭得这叫一个惊天动地。
Such cries even impress others around that “Is her a natural mother or stepmother? How cruel she is to insist on leaving her child here!”,哭得旁边人都觉得“哎呦这妈，是亲妈呀还是后妈？怎么就这么狠心，非要把孩子留在这儿呢！”
"Well, as mothers have to go to work, saying goodbye is a must.",那好，妈得上班儿啊，肯定要拜拜呀。
They may turn round look back repeatedly at every step.,妈一步三回头地走啦。
"But when mothers just disappear from children’s sights, children would stop crying and have a good time with teachers and classmates.",可是这妈妈的身影刚刚从孩子的视线中消失，孩子不哭了，跟老师同学玩儿得好着呢。
Such joy will last until their mothers pick them up in the afternoon.,等下午妈妈来接的时候也欢天喜地的。
"However, the next morning will witness another extremely sorrowful farewell play.",第二天早上又上演一场生离死别的大戏。
What are the reasons behind?,怎么回事儿啊？
"Let’s first leave aside other factors and also exclude that kindergarten is a place where children are abused, in other words, just a normal place.",咱抛开其他因素不谈啊，咱也排除说这幼儿园是一个虐待孩子的地方儿，就一正常的地方儿。
But why?,为什么呢？
Because children reflect true state of adults’ minds.,因为孩子反射了成年人内心的真实的状态。
It means that not children but their mothers hate to part.,也就是说不是孩子舍不得妈妈而是妈妈舍不得孩子。
"Therefore, emotions of mothers in that case, precisely anxiety, confusion, worry and guilt, are exactly captured by their children.",所以妈妈内心的那种，那种焦虑、纠结、不放心、内疚，孩子都敏锐地感受到了。
"In that sense, I often say to parents, “Don’t dwell on your children’s shortcomings all the time. Those faults that disgust you always be with yourselves.”",所以我就经常跟家长说：“你别老盯着你们家孩子身上那缺点，凡是你在你们家孩子身上看不惯的地方儿，你自己身上都有。”
"Children are mirrors of adults, or to be more precise, mirrors to reveal inner monsters, which can reflect that under gorgeous appearance, what is shady in our minds.",孩子就是成年人的镜子，而且是一面照妖镜，他能够照出来我们身上这华丽的袍子底下藏了什么见不得人的东西。
"They can directly demonstrate “the emperor’s new clothes” in our cases, leaving us no way and nowhere to hide our shame.",孩子能够直接照出我们身上皇帝的新装，要我们就是无地自容啊，而且是无处遁迹。
I said earlier that now I become inured to such cases.,我前边儿说过跟家长接触多了就百炼成巫。
"Sometimes, I did not listen to parents, or did not listen too much, because they cannot get to the point.",有的时候儿啊，我也不听家长，不太多听家长说什么，因为他们有时候说不到点儿上。
How can a confused person state his mind clearly?,他不知道他自己内心真实的感受是什么，所以他说不出来？
"If so, let me meet your child and everything will be abundantly clear.",让我看一眼你们家孩子，就一切昭然若揭。
"I know present here are bosses, CEO or the management.",知道在座的有好多公司的老总哈，CEO什么的。
Here is my suggestion.,我给大家提一个建议。
You can send HR managers to my training courses.,把你们那儿的人力资源经理送到我这儿来培训一下。
"After that, when you recruit new employees, interviews for adults can be then followed by casual meetings with their children.",赶明儿啊你们再招新员工的时候儿，成年人面试完之后啊，捎带手儿地看一下他们家孩子。
A brilliant and efficient method that outweighs all the test results!,这比什么考试成绩都灵！
"Today, I’m not just talking about children.",那我今天来呢不是光给大家念叨一些孩子的事情。
"In fact, imitation is our human nature as well as a great enabler to promote social development psychologically.",其实模仿是我们人类的天性，它是促进我们人类社会发展的一个非常重要的心理因素。
It doesn’t mean that we don’t imitate each other when grow up.,不是说我们长大了就不互相模仿了。
Mirror neurons exist in each brain of us.,镜像神经元存在于我们每一个人的脑中。
"That is to say, we adults also serve as mirrors and imitate each other.",我们成年人也是互为镜像、互相模仿的。
Corresponding researches began more than 100 years ago in terms of psychology.,所以对成年人之间互相模仿的研究，这心理学上也是100多年前就开始了。
"However, recently, brain science and cranial nerves have been further studied, so that our understanding of mutual imitation has been developed as well.",慢慢呢最近呢又对因为脑科学啊对脑神经这些的这个认识越来越多呢，我们对互相模仿的这个现象的认识也越来越加深了。
"Moreover, scientists have found that we adults do not only imitate actions but also, say, languages, including accent, tone and manner of speaking.",那么科学家们发现我们成年人之间也不仅是光是模仿这些动作，比如说我们还模模仿语言，包括这个口音呐、声调儿啊、语气呀什么的。
We also imitate each other’s expressions.,我们还互相模仿表情。
"If you stay with a smiling person, naturally you will smile more.",你要跟一个爱笑的人在一起时间长了诶你你也自己也笑的也也多起来。
"Otherwise, being always with a rigid face will unconsciously pass on negative mood to you.",你要跟一个满脸旧社会的人在一起，你没那么开心了。
"The most important thing is that we not only imitate these superficial, or tangible things.",最最重要的是我们不仅模仿这些表面上的东西，看得见摸得着的。
"Actually, what we really imitate from each other is our emotions, feelings, judgments and values.",其实我们真正模仿的，互相模仿的是我们的情绪、感受、判断和价值观。
"Well, it is far beyond a simple thing as we expected.",诶，这下这事儿可就闹大发了啊。
"That is to say, whether we accept, realize or admit it or not, every word, every action, even every thought of each of us affects others, and then further the whole society.",也就是说不管咱们乐意与否，咱们认识到与否，不管咱们承认与否，我们每一个人的一言一行，一举一动乃至一思一念都影响着他人，继而影响着整个社会。
Now some may argue strongly: “What you have said is totally exaggeration! How on earth can we have an influence on the whole society?”,诶，这时候可能有人就想上来揪着我脖领儿说：“哎你这人说话怎么口气这么大呀，哪儿可能啊，我哪有这么大的本事去影响全社会呢？”
My answer is that surely you can.,嘿我说：“您就是能。”
"We should ditch the dogma that influential figures in the society are merely those celebrities, politicians, big names or in our childhood, heroes, role models and idols that our teachers told us.",别以为能影响社会的都是那些名人啊，政要啊，有头有脸的人物或者是咱小时候老师给咱们树立的那些英雄啊榜样啊偶像之类的。
"In fact, they are goals out of reach.",那些人离咱远，咱够不着。
The real influentials are exactly the people around us in life.,其实真正发挥影响作用的，是咱们身边看得见摸得着的人。
"In conclusion, in our life, we should only do what is worth being imitated.",在咱们的生活中，仅仅做值得模仿的事情。
Thank you!,谢谢大家！
My topic today is Principles of Research.,今天报告的题目呢，就叫做探索的动机。
"In fact, every one of us has a strong curiosity when we are first born.",那么其实呢就是我们这个人啊，从一诞生开始啊，就是说比如说我们生出来，都有非常好的一个好奇心。
"So, an eternal topic is about where we’ve come from, where we’re going, what the future holds for us, or what the future holds for humanity as a whole.",所以它本质上有一个永恒的话题呀，就是我们从哪里来，会到哪里去，我们的未来会怎么样的，或者关心我们呢整个人类的这么一个命运。
"So, when you think about it, you may feel fear and discomfort, for example before you go out into the society or before you go to college or whatever, you may get upset.",那么当你有这样想法的时候你常常会有一些恐惧呀和不安，比如说你在走向社会上之前，或者是你在那个上大学之前等等，你就会种种不安。
"Many religions are born when people seek freedom, freedom, peace and security in their hearts.",那么为了让自己的心灵得到一种比较自由，比较释放，比较一种安宁，能够比较就是说比如说安全感，往前走的过程当中呢，其实呢就是说呢很多宗教就诞生了。
I read a book written by Van Loon years ago because the Bible itself is difficult to understand.,那比如说我好多年之前呢，在看过就是房龙写的一本书，因为《圣经》本身看起来比较困难。
Van Loon wrote a book named The Story of the Bible.,那这个房龙的书它是有个《圣经》的故事啊。
It tells why Christianity was accepted by so many people.,它里面讲为什么基督教能够受到如此广大就是人的这个接受。
"Because at that time, everyone had a very hard life and people were unequal.",因为当时呢大家都过得非常的辛苦，而且人呢是非常的不平等的。
Some were nobles and others were slaves.,有些人呢是贵族，有些人是奴隶。
"However, the appearance of Bible showed people that whether a noble or a slave, they were all a child of God who created them.",但这个《圣经》出来之后啊，它就告诉我们呢，其实所有的人呢，不论你是贵族和奴隶，都是上帝的子民，是他把你创造出来的。
"It told people that they were equal and siblings, whether they were white, black or asian.",然后呢这些人都是平等的，都是兄弟，然后呢就不管你是白肤色、黑肤色、黄肤色。
Everyone was equal.,大家也都是完全平等的。
"Hearing this, the poor suddenly realized that they were actually the same and love equally by God.",那么这么一来之后啊，就是对于那些贫苦的人来说他说噢原来我们都是一样的啊，我们都是受到上帝的关爱。
It brought great relief to their soul.,那么给自己心灵上啊是带来了非常非常大的一种解放。
This seems to me a very influential spiritual liberation in human history.,所以，这在我看来是一次人类历史上的一次非常大的一个思想的解放。
It’s actually the same with Buddhism.,那么实际上佛教本身呢也是这样的。
"Siddhartha, also known as Sakyamuni, was living a great life when he was young, but once he went out of the palace, he suddenly saw that many people were suffering from poverty, hardship and death, so he wanted to find a way to deal with these fears, and then Buddhism was born.",比如当年像悉达多，就释迦牟尼，他在年轻的时候他生活很好，但他有一次从皇宫里面出去之后啊，他忽然看到就是说，唉，原来我们这个人呢有很多贫穷、困苦、死亡，对吧，那么他就想找到一种方法来解决这些恐惧，那么这样的话呢，佛教就诞生了。
"The thing is, all this can easily be achieved during the pursuit of a free mind and inner peace.",但是问题是这些所有的这么些东西啊，它都是就是在通往你这个心灵自由和安宁的过程当中呢，其实是一种比较容易达到的这么一种境界。
All you need to do is to believe in it.,因为你相信它就可以了。
"Unfortunately, with the development of science, Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler and others discovered new knowledge through astronomical observations.",但是非常不幸的，就是说随着这科学的发展啊，到了就是说哥白尼他们通过天文的观测，还有后面的伽利略，还有后面的开普勒。
"After Galileo used glass to make telescopes and observe celestial phenomena, people accumulated a large amount of celestial data.",他们呢首次啊，就是伽利略呢用玻璃制造了望远镜去看天体的这些现象之后啊，那么他们积累了大量的天体的数据。
"In 1687, a man wrote a very important book called Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy.",到1687年的时候呢，一个人呢就是他写了本很重要的书，叫《自然哲学的数学原理》。
That man was Isaac Newton.,牛顿呢他写了这个书。
He based everything on calculus and unified them with Newton’s law of motion and the law of gravity.,那么他就把所有的东西在微积分的基础之上，有几大牛顿定律和万有引力呢，把它给统一起来了。
The uniformity brought a new liberation of minds.,那么有这统一起来之后啊，又带来我们一次新的思想的解放。
"We can see many independent phenomena, such as when I let go a small ball in my hand, it will fall down; such as the stars are moving in the sky and so on.",因为在我们看了很多独立的现象啊，比如说一个小球在天上呢我一放它会掉下来，星星在天上那个转动。
Newton believed that all these phenomena could be explained by the force of gravity.,那么这所有的现象呢，他说都可以用万有引力拿来解释。
Newton must have felt very satisfied.,那么这个牛顿他他心里肯定是非常满足的。
He believed that all the phenomena in the sky that were so sacred could be easily explained by mathematics and by calculus.,他觉得整个就是天上的这么一些非常神圣的现象啊，其实都可以用你的数学，用你的分微积分，很方便地呢把它给呢推导出来。
"Then, a new revolution was born.",那么随着后来呢就又一次新的革命呢又诞生了。
"In fact, since ancient times, we have been studying various phenomena, including magnetism, electricity and light.",我们其实在古老的时候就在研究各类现象，像那磁的现象、电的现象、光的现象。
"Based on that, in 1864, Maxwell, the scientist, came up with the Maxwell's equations.",那么有了这样以后呢，后来呢就是到了1864年呢又有位科学家麦克斯维尔呢，他建立了麦克斯维尔方程。
"With his equations, he unified many independent phenomena, such as the existence of electricity, magnetism, light.",那么根据他的方程组之后啊，他把很多独立的现象，电、磁、光等等呢，都能够用一组方程组啊，把它给统一起来了。
This brought us a second spiritual liberation.,那么这么一来呢就给我们带来第二次就是思想上的解放。
"Both theories tell us that a lot of things can be predicted, but on the other hand, you will find a lots of things unsatisfactory.",啊所以这两套理论都告诉我们：一方面让你感觉到好多东都可以预测，可以来进行预言；但是从另外一方面呢你又有很多让你不满意的地方。
"According to the laws of Newtonian mechanics, as long as we know the initial conditions, we can use the calculus equations to calculate.",比如这个牛顿力学告诉我们，就是一旦啊，就是说我知道了力，知道了我们的初始条件，那么有这微积分的方程之后呢。
"We can then calculate how the particles make up the individual. This individual can be Pan Jianwei, President Zhang Jie or any of you.",我们以后啊这些粒子什么时候组成一个潘建伟，什么时候组成一个张杰校长比如说，组成你们里面的每一个个体啊，都是可能从过去就可以把它算出来了。
"In that sense, who among you here today is going to be an entrepreneur or a university professor has nothing to do with personal effort in some sense.",那么这么一来的话，我们今天在这个地方将来谁会成为企业家，谁会成为大学的教授，其实某种意义上讲，跟个人的努力呀是没有任何关系的。
Because our fate was determined long ago by forces and equations.,因为呢我们的命运在老早之前就已经被力，被方程所决定了。
"It was not until the beginning of the last century, with the advent of quantum mechanics, that this problem was satisfactorily solved.",那么这个问题呀一直到上世纪初，随着量子力学的发现呢，得到了就是比较满意的解决。
Quantum mechanics tells us a basic principle.,那么在这个地方呢，量子力学呢它就告诉我们它一个基本的这么一个原理呀。
"That is, in daily life, it is impossible for me to be in Beijing at the same time when I am in Jiaotong University.",就是说我们的每天这个日常生活当中啊，比如说我在交大这个时候我就不可能在北京。
"As I have shown in the pictures, when I’m here, I cannot be there.",所以这里面我在图片里面所放的呢，我在这里或者在那里，只能在某一个地方。
It’s impossible for me to appear in several places at the same time.,不可能同时在好几个地方同时出现。
There is a principle called quantum superposition in quantum mechanics.,但是呢到量子力学里面的时候呢，它有一个量子叠加原理啊。
"It tells us that in a universe, when you don’t have any information about where an object is, the object could be everywhere at the time.",它就告诉我们呢，当在整个宇宙当中你都没有关于某一个客体在什么地方的信息的时候，那么其实你同时可以在任何一个地方，叫everywhere。
That can be calculated with wave function.,根据这个波函数这么个解释的话。
Let me explain.,所以我就是具体地解释一下它的含义。
"For example, I went to Frankfurt for a visit and then came back to Shanghai.",比如说我呢到法兰克福去访问，然后呢回到了上海。
"After returning to Shanghai, I found that I had been to Frankfurt 10,000 times, probably many times during the trip I was asleep, but also many times I was awake and knew my route.",回到上海之后呢，我发现我访问了1万次啊，我大概是有好多次呢我睡觉睡着了，好多次我是眼睛睁开我在看我从哪边过来的。
"So if when everytime I were asleep, there are people around me of course, suppose that there were not a single machine in the entire universe that could detect which route I had taken.",那么结果我每次我在睡觉的时候，然后当然周围的所有的人，假定整个宇宙当中没有任何一台仪器呀来探测我是从哪条航线过来的话。
"Then since there are two routes, one passes by Moscow, the other Singapore, when I woke in Shanghai and people around asked me where I had come from, I would have a mixed feeling of the cold and the heat and I would be wondering which way I had taken.",那么因为我这里有两条航线，一条是莫斯科一条新加坡，那么等到我上海醒来的时候我碰到你们，你们问我你是从哪来从哪里过来的，我就会有一种冷热交加的感觉，那我不知道我从哪边过来。
"If I stayed awake during the journey, I would have a clearer idea of the route and know where I come from.",那么如果说我在醒着再看我是从哪一条路上过来的时候呢，我总是处在那么要么就感觉比较寒冷，要么就感觉比较温暖。
Quantum mechanics tells us that detecting an objective system with a very fine probe can have an effect on its whole process.,所以这个量子力学就告诉我们呢，就是说如果说你用一个非常微弱的探测，去探测一个客观的体系的话，其实是会它的整个体系的进程是会有影响的。
"From this perspective, it represents a very positive philosophy.",从这个角度上来讲呢，它的哲学就是是一个非常积极的哲学了。
You may then want to integrate quantum mechanics and relativity.,那么正因为有了量子力学之后，我们把相对论结合在一起。
"As I mentioned, classical mechanics doesn’t answer the question of where we came from and where we go.",因为我刚才讲到前面的经典力学，它不能回答我们从哪里来到哪里去的问题。
The world seems to go on forever.,就是说我们好像好像这个世界永远会这样发展下去。
"We seem to be eternal, and time seems to go on forever.",我们是永恒的，时间是永恒地流逝的。
"By combining quantum mechanics with relativity, we can explore the origin of the universe.",但是一旦有了这么一个量子力学和相对论结合在一起了之后啊，那么我们就说呢我们就可以呢来探索一下这个宇宙的起源了。
"About the origin of the universe, let’s first assume how big the universe really is.",那么宇宙的起源，首先我想呢我们先假定一下这个宇宙到底有多大。
"Now we can see about a few thousand stars in the night sky, as shown here.",那么其实我们目前的夜空当中啊，我们大概可以看到几千颗恒星，在这个图里面大家可以看到。
This is actually a very small part.,其实是非常非常小的一部分。
There are probably hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy.,在这个银河系里面呢，大概有数千亿颗恒星。
"The universe we know is about 10 billion light years wide, and within this universe, there are hundreds of billions of galaxies.",那么在我们已经知道的这宇宙当中，大概有一百多亿光年，在这么大小的一个宇宙里面呢，我们又有数千亿个银河系。
"From this point, you will find that the universe is so grand and you will be amazed by the vastness of the universe.",那么从这个角度上讲，你就觉得宇宙之大，你又感到非常地惊奇，有一种敬畏感。
This sense of awe is necessary.,有这种敬畏感是非常需要的。
Why?,为什么呢？
"When science breaks down religious beliefs, we behave as if we can do whatever we want.",当科学带来破坏性的结果把我们那些宗教的信仰给破坏掉之后啊，我们做人做事就好像就可以无法无天了。
"Then once you are amazed by the vast universe and you are in awe of it, you will have some new feelings.",那一旦你对这个宇宙那有一种惊喜和敬畏感之后啊，恐怕呢你又会呢有一些新的感受。
It was because of these processes that our lifes evolved.,那么正是因为有这样的一些过程，慢慢的呢我们的生命啊就开始进化了。
"About 100 million to 200 million years ago, mammals emerged.",大概到了一点多亿年之前呢，我们就有了所谓的哺乳动物。
"After a long period of evolution, hominids emerged a million years ago, and then homo sapiens emerged a few hundred thousand years ago.",那么经过这个一个漫长的进化，到了就是说100万年之前呢，我们就有我们的原始人，然后到几十万年之前呢我们就有了智人。
"After the homo sapiens, ten thousand years ago, modern man finally appeared.",有了智人之后到了1万年之前呢，终于呢产生了我们的现代人，啊。
It’s basically the history of our entire world.,大概就是我们整个宇宙的这么一个历史。
"After so many years of scientific exploration, we are gradually answering the questions that have existed since the birth of mankind.",那么这样的话也就是在科学的本身经过这么就是说是这么多年的探索，慢慢地我们能够来回答我们从有人类以来的但一直存在着的问题。
What will the future of mankind look like?,那么这个人类的未来会怎么样呢？
We still don’t know.,现在还是不知道的。
There’s a good chance that this depends on the situation of the exploration of dark energy.,那么非常的非常大的程度上啊，是要依赖于就是说我们就是可能是这个暗能量呢到底是怎么样的这么一个情况。
"One possibility is that the universe will experience a big bang, then it will expand first before contracting.",那么在这过程当中一种可能，也许呢宇宙先大爆炸，到最后呢又膨胀膨胀又会收缩。
Another possibility is that it will expand forever.,另外一种呢可能永远地膨胀下去了，啊。
Some believe that the universe will continue to chill and the universe will experience a heat death.,另外一种呢甚至呢还有就是说是就是越来越冷越来越冷，那么整个宇宙呢又会重新地归向于热寂。
"Therefore, many astronomers claimed that we are at the best age of the universe.",所以从这个角度上来讲啊，我们目前是我们处于这个宇宙的按照天文学家的好多人的观点是这个最美好的时候了。
"Many people often ask, “Are we the only living system in the universe? The only system that allows life?”",也就是说我们可能大家都经常会问，我们是在宇宙当中是唯一的吗，是不是只有我们这么一个体系？
"Of course, there are multiple views.",对吧，是能够有生命的诞生，那么当然有多种观点。
"Regardless of these divergent opinions, by all means, the mother universe has givin birth to us, that is how we exist as individuals in the first place.",那么对于这不同的观点啊，不管如何来说，这个宇宙的母亲把我们孕育出来，而且能产生我们这个人属。
"According to John Archibald Wheeler, it is no piece of cake for us to have eyes evolved and then explore the world with them.",按照John惠勒的观点，能够诞生他慢慢出来这长出这么一只眼睛，来反过来回馈来研究这个世界呀，这是一个非常非常不容易的事情。
"From the Buddhist point of view, this is a kind of fate.",或者说大家说都可以用佛学的观点来讲，就相当于一种缘分，嗯。
There is a deeper question.,那么现在大家就有这么一个进一步的问题。
"As you may have noticed, there are many parallels between the Bible, Chinese creation myths and the current big bang theory.",就是说目前我们大概知道，对吧，我们的这个所谓的理解呀，跟《圣经》啊、跟我们的中国的盘古开天辟地里面的很多内容好像是跟我们目前大爆炸理论里面，或多或少是有契合之处。
"But there is a very important question that remains unanswered, which is why people have consciousness and thoughts that allow them to understand the world.",那么但是还有个很重要的问题目前是没有解决的，就是为什么我们这个人是会有意识，是会有思想，能够反过来理解这个世界。
"Our point is that, with the development of quantum mechanics goes further, what impresses us most is that this provides us with a means to understand the universe.",那么我们的就是观点呢，就是随着我们对这个量子力学研究的进一步地深入，对于我们来说最深刻的，其实是能够让我们有一种手段来认识我们这个宇宙。
"Knowledge of the universe has brought us many useful things, such as computers, information science, energy science, life science and material science.",但是认识了宇宙之后啊，其实本质上呢已经给我们带来了非常多有用的东西了，比如说我们的计算机啊，能源信息科学啊，能源科学啊，还有我们的就是说是生命科学呀，还有材料科学啊。
They are all based on the applications of quantum mechanics laws.,都是建立在这个量子力学规律的这个应用之上。
"With the development of this science, we can gradually gain an active control of these tiny quanta.",那么随着这个科学的发展呢，我们慢慢地啊就能够对这个一颗颗小颗粒啊进行一个主动的操纵了。
"At present, there is a hot topic in the discussion among people.",那么在不久的将来，就目前大家有一个就是讨论热点，讨论热点之一是什么呢。
People are worried that artificial intelligence will defeat human beings?,就是说哎我们觉大家非常担心啊，我们现在这个人工智能就是会不会就是战胜我们人类？
"Till now, I think that we are very safe, this is just my personal opinion, maybe some of you here disagree.",那么到目前为止啊，我觉得呢我们是可以非常的，按照我的观点哦，可能在座的可能有些人都不一定是认可我的观点的。
"But personally, I think we are very safe and we don't need to worry about being overtaken by Artificial Intelligence for now.",就是按照我的观点呢，目前我们是可以还是非常就是安全的，不用来担心目前人工智能呢会超越我们的人类的。
Let’s come back to classical mechanics.,那么这里呢我就又回到就是这个所谓的经典力学里面来说。
We know that classical mechanics is deterministic.,那么我们知道经典力学是决定论的。
It claims that everything can be measured accurately and that measurement has no effect on it.,什么东西都是可以精确测量的，你去测量它是对它不会有影响的。
"The same applies to computers, where every piece of information and every program can be copied.",那我们的计算机也是这样的，计算机里面的每一个信息，每每一个里面的程序啊都是可以复制的。
"In addition, the computer has a big weakness.",那么另外计算机还有一个很大的弱点。
It has no free will.,它跟我们人呢就是没有个自由的意志的选择。
"For example, there are two computers and two bottles of water.",比如说我说在这个就在这两边正好呢放着两台计算机，我说放着相当于呢有就是呃两瓶水。
"If I were a machine and someone else told me that,""Pan Jianwei, fetch a bottle of water"". Now I'm a robot.",那么两瓶水如果我是一个计算机的话，比如说另外一个人说诶，这个潘建伟，我是个就机器人对吧，你帮我去拿一瓶水来。
"If the distance between me and the two bottles of water is the same, if the energy I need and I will consume when fetching the water are completely identical, if all these are not set beforehand, then I will crash.",如果这两瓶水的大小，离开我的距离，而且我去拿这瓶水所需要的能量和各种消耗，都是完全一样的话，如果你事先没有进行预置的话，那计算机就死机了。
"In the face of such a simple problem, even the most powerful computer could not make a simple judgment, if there are no human intervention or presetting.",也就是对于这么一个简单的问题啊，我们哪怕是非常非常强大的计算机如果没有人工的干预，没有事前的预置的话，它都是没有做出一个非常简单的这么一个判断的。
I think that the generation of human consciousness may be explained by randomness and wave function collapse in quantum mechanics.,那么在我看来呢我觉得我们的意识的产生啊，跟我们人的这个是这个为什么会有意识啊，是很有可能是跟我们量子力学里面的这样一种随机性和它的这个随机的波函数的塌缩是有一定的联系的。
"That means as we learn more about quantum control and interactions, it may not be long before we discover the secrets of human consciousness.",那么也就是说随着我们对就是当量子的这个控制和相互作用的认识越来越进一步地了解，啊，我们呢就能够呢可能在不久的将来啊能回答就是我们人为什么会有意识这么一个问题。
"I think the most amazing thing is that the universe has evolved from a non-living state to the present state, and this process can in turn help us understand the world.",所以我觉得最神奇的事，就是说宇宙是从没有生命开始进化出个有生命的东西来，它能够反过来来观照我们这个世界。
"In fact, the topic today, “Principles of Research”, is from Einstein’s speech at Max Planck’s 70th birthday.",其实我这个题目啊是引用了就是爱因斯坦在庆祝普朗克七十周岁生日的时候的他的一个演讲。
"In his speech, he said that people always pursue cruelly in order to satisfy their stomach.",那么他在这个演讲里面讲啊，他说我们这个人啊，注定的就要为了满足这个胃啊，去做一种所谓的非常残酷的无休止的追逐，对吧。
I am sure that all of you are smart enough to do that.,那么通过努力我想在座的各位凭大家的智商都是可以满足的。
"However, Einstein didn’t think it was enough to make you a complete person.",但是在爱因斯坦认为仅仅靠这样的话是不能成为一个完整的人。
"As I said, religion is a rather convenient solution, but science tells us that religion is unreliable.",那么他说我刚才前面讲了一条最比较方便的途径就是信仰宗教，但现在的科学又告诉我们，就是说宗教这条途径啊它是不可靠的。
"Einstein learnt about the laws of physics at a very young age, so he knew there was no real heaven.",所以其实爱因斯坦他在非常年轻的时候，他了解了一些物理学的规律之后，他知道这个真正的天堂是不存在的。
What is really reliable is our understanding and knowledge of the world through our observations and research.,但是呢有一个非常可靠的途径啊，就通过对我们这个世界的观测和凝视和研究，我们得到了一些理解和知识。
This knowledge is eternal and independent from our existence.,它是永恒的，是独立我们永永久的存在的。
The liberation that comes with understanding of the world will ultimately lead us to spiritual freedom and peaceful mindset.,那么对这个世界的理解所带来的思想的解放啊，其实最后是能给我们带来我们的心灵的自由和安宁。
"I think that for all the scientists, the primary purpose of research is to acquire the spiritual freedom and a inner peace.",我觉得对于所有的科学工作者或者科研工作者来讲啊，我们这个探索的动机的最主要的目的啊，是为了来就达到一种心灵的自由和安宁。
Thank you!,谢谢大家！
Hello everyone!,大家好！
Today I will give an introduction on Baidu Translate.,今天我来为大家介绍一下百度机器翻译。
Let’s start with the application of machine translation.,首先来介绍一下机器翻译的应用。
This is a picture of Rosetta Stone which is very familiar to us.,我们来看这样一张图片，这是大家所比较熟悉的一个叫罗塞塔石碑。
"It is inscribed with three versions of a decree issued when King Ptolemy V. in ancient Egypt was crowned. The top one is in Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic, the middle is in Demotic while the bottom is in Greek used in Ancient Egypt.",它上面用三种文字记录了古埃及的国王托勒密五世继位时的这种诏书，上面是古埃及的象形文字，中间是古埃及的通俗体，下面是古埃及的用的希腊文字。
The three scripts record the same thing.,那么这三种文字呢所记录的是同样一件事情。
But over time ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic and demotic have been forgotten.,但是随着时间的流逝，古埃及的象形文字和通俗体已经不为人们所知。
"When this stone was discovered, nobody really knew what its inscriptions mean.",当人们发掘出这块石碑的时候，完全不知道上面介绍的内容是什么。
"But fortunately, the Greek used in ancient Egypt is interconected with modern Greek.  So an idea occurred to some people that the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic script probably can be deciphered with modern Greek. And it was proved working.",但是所幸的是呢，最下面的古埃及所用的希腊文字跟现在的希腊语是相通的，所以呢人们就想能不能用希腊语来破译出古埃及的象形文字，那么这种方法呢经验证是可行的。
Thus people got to know the things recorded on the stone and the Egyptian hieroglyphic script was successfully deciphered.,从而人们知道这个石碑上所记录的一些事情，并且成功地破译出了古埃及的象形文字。
This method actually made use of machine translation. We can use machine translation to decipher languages.,那么这一方法实际上就是一个利用了机器翻译的技术，我们可以用机器翻译来做这样的一些文字解密工作。
So machine translation is somewhat fantastic.,所以机器翻译还是挺神奇的。
"Well, here's the question: what is machine translation?",那么什么是机器翻译呢？
"In simple terms, machine translation is the process of translating from one natural language to another using a computer.",简单来说，机器翻译就是利用计算机，将一种自然语言翻译为另外一种自然语言。
Natural languages are languages used by human and are unique to human.,所谓自然语言就是我们人类所用的语言，就是人类所独有的。
"After thousands years of evolution, we have truly mastered this convenient tool of communication.",那么经过几千年的进化呢，人们熟练地掌握了这一个快捷地交流的功能。
Let’s look at this passage.,那么我们来看这样一段文字。
It is written in Arabic. You may feel baffled or even helpless looking at it.,这是一段阿拉伯语，大家初看起来啊可能是觉得诶摸不着头脑，非常的崩溃。
What does it say?,它到底是说了一段什么话呢？
"If it were in English or Japanese, I might be able to guess the meaning of it.",比如说你要是给我一段英语或者是一段日语，我可能还能猜出其中的意思。
But it is in Arabic! How can we manage to know what it intends to express?,但是对于这样一段完全不知所云的阿拉伯语，那么我们怎么知道它想表达的是什么内容呢？
"With machine translation, we can know its meaning after getting its Chinese translation. This is the magic of machine translation.",那么借助于机器翻译，我们就可以知道翻译为汉语以后啊，它想表达的一个意思，这就是机器翻译一个神奇的地方。
"Machine translation holds so much significance in multi-language information retrieval, cross-language communication, and international trade.",诶机器翻译在多语言的信息获取、跨语言的交流，以及国际化商贸等方面有着重要的意义。
"For example, we can use machine translation to get countries' economic information, news and intelligence in real time, especially intelligence that may be militarily important.",比如说我们可以利用机器翻译来实时地获取国外的经呃经济、新闻以及一些情报，尤其是情报的获取，可能对于军事上来说是非常重要的。
"In fact, it is for military purposes that many countries have funded the research on machine translation.",而实际上很多国家所之所以资助机器翻译的研究，正是出于军事目的的需要。
"In the United States there is a world-class machine translation evaluation every year. It focuses on lanugages which are politically sensitive or important to the United States, such as Arabic and Chinese.",比如美国它会每年举行一个呃世界级的机器翻译评测，它所关注的语种都是一些比较敏感，或者说对美国而言比较重要的语言，比如阿拉伯语、汉语等等。
Ordinary people can utilize this technology to achieve cross-language communication.,那么对于我们普通的民众而言呢，我们可以利用机器翻译来进行这样一些跨语言的交流和沟通。
"For instance, thanks to machine translation, we can communicate with foreigners face to face when traveling abroad, or chat with them on line.",比如当我们出国旅游的时候，跟外国朋友可以面对面地进行交流，或者在网上的时候，我们与国外的朋友进行交流。
"In addition, now many people shop on overseas websites. With the help of machine translation, we can translate the product information, prices, and addresses, and communicate with foreign customer service staff.",另外啊现在还有很多朋友通过网络进行海淘以及国外的购物，那么这个时候啊，机器翻译也能够帮助我们，比如可以翻译商品信息、价格、地址、与国外的客服交流等等。
So machine translation has become more of a part of our daily lives.,所以呢机器翻译越来越多地融入到了我们普通民众的生活当中。
"For example, we can use machine translation to help us memorizing new words, reading and writing in English or other languages.",比如在学习方面，我们可以用机器翻译来进行呃辅助我们背单词、阅读、啊以及英语写作、外语写作等等。
"As for reading, as I have mentioned earlier, we can take advantage of machine translation to obtain financial information, news, military and political information of other countries.",那么在阅读方面，刚才提到的，我们可以利用机器翻译来获取国外的一些财经信息呀、新闻信息呀还有一些其他的，呃像一些军事啊政治啊等等这样的信息。
"Aside from this, we can communicate smoothly with foreign friends face to face, no matter ",呃另外呢就是跟国外的朋友面对面的交流，无论是文字的也好，语音的也好，都可以无障碍地交流。
"And in addition to personal overseas web shopping, machine translation can also be used for state-level trade.",那么以及啊除了我们平时所谓的海淘啊，呃个人行为的商贸以外，国家行为的商贸也可以利用机器翻译来做。
"And it's useful in travelling, which is attractive to all of us.",啊同样的还有啊大家比较啊感兴趣的旅游。
"When you are traveling abroad, carrying with you a machine translation software is like hiring an interpreter who can help us communicate with foreigners.",嗯呃当大家出国旅游的时候，也可以携带一款机器翻译的软件，就像自己带了一个随身翻译家一样，帮助我们进行交流。
So machine translation has been applied in our lives in many aspects.,机器翻译在我们的生活中也已经得到了很多的应用。
"As depicted in the first picture, three Russians were lost and could not find their way home in China.",比如说第一张图片是说有三个俄罗斯人在中国走丢了，啊找不到回家的路了。
"Fortunately, they encountered a kindhearted police officer. However, the officer cannot communicate with them in English.",这个时候啊，他们遇到了我们热心的民警同志，但是民警同志也没有办法跟他们用英语进行交流。
What should they do in this case?,这怎么办呢？
"The officer downloaded Baidu Translate, which supports translation between Russian and Chinese. Only then did the police officer know that they were Russians and send them home.",诶民警同志下载了百度翻译，我们支持俄语和汉语之间的互译，这样啊才知道这三个人是俄罗斯人，并且呢把他们送回了家。
"The second picture tells a story involves a traffic officer and, coincidentally, a russian who violated traffic rules in Shenzhen.",第二个是说深圳的交警，啊同样的也是俄罗斯人，很很很凑巧啊，他在深圳的呃道路上啊有了交呃违规行为。
The officer used our translation software to communicate with the traffic violator and do his job.,那么交警呢也利用我们的翻译软件呃与这样一个违规者进行交流，进行交警的执法。
"In the third picture, a bus conductor found a wallet in the bus. Through translation, he realized that the wallet belonged to a young man from Pakistan.",那么第三个是一个公交车的售货员，他在公交车上发现了有个钱包，唉经过翻译以后啊，他发现这个钱包是一个巴基斯坦小伙子呃所丢失的。
He therefore used Baidu Translate to communicate with this Pakistani and returned the wallet to him.,他于是啊就随身带着百度翻译去跟这个巴基斯坦的小伙子交流，把钱包送到啦他的手中。
"As you can see, Baidu Translate is genuinely helping us communicate with foreigners.",所以啊我们可以看到翻译是真真正正地在帮助了我们普通人进行呃外语交流。
The following pictures show the comments that some internet users posted on Weibo and Wechat after they used Baidu Translate.,下面这样一些图片啊是网上的一些嗯网友，他们使用了百度翻译以后，啊一些感受就贴在了自己的微博上或者是朋友圈里面，哦我们拿出来一些跟大家分享。
"The first shows the scenario of foreign language learning. Along with the translation of such a passage, Baidu Translate lists its key words and expressions. ",比如第一列是一个外语学习的场景，啊通过这样翻译这样一段话，翻译可以给出一些重点词汇诶以及句式的表达等等。
"The second is a case that a man lost his umbrella traveling in Thailand, but found it with the help of Baidu Translate.",第二列呢是有一个朋友去泰国旅游，他的伞丢了，那么呢通过翻译呢也找回了他的伞。
The third shows users' needs for chatting and socialization.,第三列是呃聊天交友一类的需求。
The fourth shows users' needs for online overseas shopping.,第四列就是我们刚才提到的海外购物的需求。
"The following three pictures are about camera translation, a combination of machine translation and OCR, Optical Character Recogntion.",下面这三张图片呢是机器翻译跟OCR所谓的光学字符识别结合呃这样一个拍照翻译的呃功能。
These three pictures demostrate the camera translation feature.,下面三幅图片展示了拍照翻译的功能。
"For example, many of you might have bought lots of thingss while traveling abroad. But you may not know how to use them for their instructions are in foreign languages.",比如说有很多朋友可能去国外买了很多商品，但是不知道它的使用方法，因为啊说明书都是外文的。
"In the first picture is the instruction of a rice cooker made in Japan. As you can see, it is written in Japanese.",比如第一呃第一张图片展示的是嗯一个日本的电饭锅的使用方法，那么它是用日文来表达的。
"Apparently, we cannot use it if we do not understand Japanese.",这样显然我们是没有办法使用的。
"Having the instruction translated by taking a picture, we can know how to use it. ",所以我们可以通过拍照加翻译的方法来知了解哎该怎么使用。
"For example, it tells you whether you should use the provided cup to measure the rice. If you use other containers, measurement errors might occur.",比如说你是不是应该用他提供的容器来进行量米，呃如果使用其他的容器呢可能导致了测量的误差。
Such useful information is directly presented.,所以这是能直接给到我们这样的有用的信息。
"The second picture is about such a case that I went shopping abroad and saw something that I didn't know what it was. But I directly took a picture of it. With a finger wipe on the texts, I managed to know it was fish oil. In the same way, I was able to know how to use it, the daily dose and ingredients.",那么第二张图片是说我去国外买了哎我不知道这是一个什么东西，但是我可以直接对着这个商品拍照，拍完照以后啊通过涂抹，哎我们知道噢原来这是鱼油，并且呢同样的你可以知道它该怎么用，每天服几粒，它里面的成分是什么。
It is no doubt that Baidu Translate is of great help while we are shopping abroad.,这样我们就呃出国购物的时候呢也会呃有很大的帮助。
"The third picture is about the scenario of travelling abroad. for example, museums and tourist attractions abroad usually provide written introductions.",第三个场景是说我们去国外参观的时候，比如说去博物馆，去一些旅游景点呀，通常会有一些文字的介绍。
"We want to know about the history and culture of a foreign country, but we can not due to our ignorance of the local language.",我们想了解一下外国的一些文化呀历史呀，但是呢又苦于没有办法，不知道当地的语言，这怎么办呢？
This problem can also be solved by taking a picture.,同样也可以用拍照方式来解决。
"For example, as in this picture, this buddy is visiting the Berlin Wall in Germany and seeing such an introduction passage on the wall, in German.",比如说这张图片是一位朋友去德国的柏林墙，呃他去那里参观，发现柏林墙上有这样一段文字的介绍，但是是德语的介绍。
"We can also take a picture of it, using Baidu Translate.",那么我们同样也可以用拍照的方法，嗯拿出百度翻译拍一个照片儿。
"Then we can know it's about the history of the Berlin Wall, its maintenance and its collapse.",然后啊就可以知道这是柏林墙，它的修复呀，它的倒塌呀等等这样一些内容。
"In fact, we started building the core R&D team of Baidu Translate in 2010.",那么百度翻译实际上我们从10年的时候就组建了核心的研发团队。
"In June of 2011, we launched the function of Chinese-English translation, which can translate Chinese into English and vice versa.",在2011年的6月份的时候，我们推出了中英互译，就是中文翻译成英文，并且英文也可以翻译成中文。
"In the following years, we expanded the number of languages to 28, covering most countries and regions of the world.",在随后的几年里我们呢就迅速地把这个语种进行扩大，现在已经支持了全球28种语言的互译，基本上覆盖了主要的国家和地区。
"In other words, it supports translation between any two of the 28 languages, that is, 756 translation directions.",这28种语言互译的意思是说，它们两两之间可以互相翻译，一共呢有756个翻译方向。
"Baidu Translate is now responding to over 100 million requests each day, for translating poems, papers, product introductions, social conversations, and cyberwords and other texts.",每天响应来自全球过亿次的翻译请求，这里面啊既有一些像诗歌的翻译请求，也有像学术论文啊、像商品呀、啊像呃一些交友啊、网啊以及一些网络用语啊等等的翻译请求。
Let me give you some of its typical application scenarios.,下面呢我列出几种典型的应用场景。
What exactly can we do with the help of Baidu Translate?,就是大家可以用百度翻译来干什么呢？
"We have opened the API of Baidu Translate, so third parties,for example, dictionary service websites including iCiba and Dict Hujiang, can easily call our translation API.",因为我们开放了百度翻译的API接口，所以呢第三方可以很容易地来调用我们的翻译API，那么比如说像一些词典类的网站，像金山词霸呀、沪江翻译啊。
"Originally they only provide dictionary services, and can not handle sentences.",它们最开始的时候啊只提供词典这种查询，但是对于一个句子而言，它们可能没有这样的能力。
"By calling the Baidu Translate API, they can be applied to meet more needs.",通过调用百度翻译呢，那么就可以增强了这种呃产品的功能，提升应用的多样性。
"The second scenario is e-commerce and foreign trade, which I have mentioned before.",第二种场景就是刚才提到的电商外贸行业。
"We can use it to translate product names, details and addresses, not only from Chinese into other languages but vice versa.","我们可以翻译一些商品名称啊，商品详情啊以及地址啊,不仅是把中文翻译成外语，也可以把外语翻译成中文。"
"Thus we can shop easily, language-barrier-free.",这样我们在购物的时候就可以有比较呃这种便捷的途径，不再受到语言的呃阻碍。
"Thirdly, it can be applied in other utility applications . For example, we use the API as a plug-in in our products like Baidu Browser.",第三种应用场景就是一些工具类的应用，比如说我们可以把翻译的API放到我们的产品里面去做一个插件，比如放到百度浏览器里面去。
"When we browse foreign webpages, it will translate those pages into Chinese, so that we can easily gain a clue about their content,",那么当我们直接浏览外国网页的时候啊，它会把相应的外语翻译成中文，我们就能很容易地、很方便地获取到这个网页所介绍的内容。
"for example, news, information, finance. we can bridge the language gap through Baidu Translate.",比如说新闻类的、资讯类的呀、财经类的呀等等，这样我们就弥补了这个语言的鸿沟。
"In addition, as I have mentioned, machine translation can be applied in conjunction with speech recognition.",另外就是像刚才提到的机器翻译跟语音识别相结合。
"We have speech translation, a practical feature that allows us directly speak to the APP. So we can talk to foreign friends in a more natural way.",啊可以呃我们可以有这个语音翻译的功能，这是一个非常实用的功能，就是它解放了我们的双手，可以直接对着APP来进行说话，那么与外国的朋友进行啊面对面的这种交流更加自然。
"Besides, machine translation can also be combined with image recognition, enabling translation by taking a picture.",第二种就是我刚才提到的机器翻译和图像识别相结合，啊我们来进行拍照翻译。
This is rather helpful when we cannot speak and type the local language while traveling abroad. ,这种情况是说我们在对外国的语言既不会说也不会写的情况下。
"For example, when traveling in Thailand or encountering something in Arabic that we cannot type, what should we do?",那么比如说去泰国，像刚才提到的阿拉伯语，我们实在是没有办法输入，那么怎么办呢？
We can take a picture of it.,啊我们可以拍照。
"When we see a guideboard or signpost on the road, or a menu in a restaurant, we can take a picture of it and have it translated into our own language, so that we can read, understand and make decisions.",拍照的一些呃很方便的应用场景是说我们在路上看到一个路牌儿指示牌儿，以及我们在餐厅里看见菜单等等，我们都可以拍一张照片，将它翻译为我们自己的语言进行阅读，获取信息，作出选择。
"Interestingly, machine translation can also be utilized to compose poems.",另外还有一个比较有趣的呃应用啊是说翻译也可以用来写诗。
You might be intrigued that why translation and writing poems are comaprable.,这个可能大家觉得哎稍微有点比较奇怪，写诗跟翻译怎么能哎相提并论呢？
"Actually there are rules for poetry. There are word limit, rhyme and rhythm.",其实是这样的，就是我们的诗歌啊也是非常有规律的，因为它有字数的限制啊有韵律的限制。
"On the other hand, we can regard the process of poem writing as that of translation.",另外一个方面，我们可以把诗歌也可以看成翻译的这样一个问题。
"If the second line of a poem is generated based on the first line, the first line can be seen as the source language and the second line the target language. This is actually a process of translation. ",比如诗歌的第一句生成第二句，那么如果我们把第一句当作源语言，第二句当作目标语言，那么就是一个翻译的问题。
"We can generate the second line using the first line, and the third and fourth line in exactly the same way, until a poem is completed.",我们通过第一句生成第二句，再生成第三句，生成第四句，直到这首诗生成完毕。
"Here are two poems, one written by human and the other by machine.",这里面展示出了两首诗，一首是人写的，一首是机器写的。
Can you guess which one is written by human and which one by machine?,大家可以猜一下，哪首是人写的，哪首是机器写的？
Ok I won't leave you hanging. The poem on the left is written by human and the right one comes from machine.,好我就不卖关子啦，这里呀我们可以看到左边这一首是人写的诗，右边这一首是机器写的诗。
"Here are another two poems, one written by human and the other by machine.",我们再来看另外两首诗，同样也是一首是人写的，一首是机器写的。
"On this occasion, the left one is written by an automatic poem generator and the right one by human.",但是呢这边是左边是自动写诗的程序写的，右边是人写的。
Did you guess right?,大家都猜对了吗？
"In the development, we have two test groups, one composed of ordinary users and the other of Chinese linguistic experts.",我们在开发过程中也找到两组人去进行测试，第一组是我们的普通用户，另外一组呢就是汉语言文字的专家。
We presented the ordinary users with two poems and asked them to tell which one  is written by human and which one by machine.,那么在普通用户这个群体里面，大家都我们给他两首诗说你能分辨出哪一首是人写的，哪一首是机器写的吗？
Only 50% of them were able to give the right answer.,这个正确率只有50%左右。
"In other words, most people cannot tell the difference between poems produced by human and those by machine.",也就是说啊大部分的人都很难分辨出机器写诗和诶人写诗的区别。
So the machine results are quite convincing.,所以诶几乎可以达到以假乱真的程度。
"Nevertheless, 80% of the expert group were able to tell the differences. So the experts are indeed experts. They can figure out whether a poem is written by human or machine.",那么在专家组啊这一个数据是80%，所以专家还是很厉害的，他能够看出来诶这首是人写的，这一首是机器写的。
Machine poem writing is afflicted by shortcomings in artistic conception. So it still has a long way to go.,是因为呀机器来写诗在意境上面啊还是有一些存在一些差距的，所以前进的道路还是很长。
"Ok, this is all I want to share with you about the applications of Baidu Translate.",好，关于机器翻译的应用，我就介绍到这里。
I believe you must all be very familiar with this clip from the movie Avatar.,刚才这个片段相信大家都很熟悉，那是电影《阿凡达》中的片段。
"The floating ""Hallelujah Mountain"" in Avatar, was inspired by the Southern Sky Column of Zhangjiajie.",电影《阿凡达》中间的悬浮山，也是哈路路亚山，就是张家界的南天一柱。
"The hero, Jake Sully, was sent there in the vanguard of occupying the mountain.",里面的主人公杰克·萨利，曾经是我们人类去占领这个山的一个前锋。
"However, he later betrayed his fellows and became a warrior for environmental protection.",可是他后来背叛了人类，加入了生态环境保护的行列，成了一位生态保护的战士。
So here today I want to share with you my story.,那么今天，我到这里来其实也想讲一下我自己的故事。
"Seven years ago, I worked as an environmental public relations specialist in a multinational company.",七年前，我曾经在一家跨国公司做环境公关。
The company owned more than 6 million mu of forest in China and 17 production bases.,这家公司在中国拥有六百多万亩的林地，有十七个生产基地。
It had an annual production capacity of over 7 million tons in pulp and paper and its annual sales could reach 30 billion yuan.,每年生产纸浆、造纸大概年产能大概700多万吨，一年的销售额达到300多亿人民币。
My job in this company was to deal with challenges from all sorts of non-governmental organizations featuring environmental protection and those from media concerning the environment.,我在这家公司的主要工作是面对各种环境的民间环保组织，乃至媒体的环境方面的挑战。
"When I joined this company, it was right under the spotlight for it had planted eucalyptus trees at large scale in Yunnan province and Hainan province, which was strongly protested by NGOs such as Green Peace, Friends of the Earth and Global Village as well as the college student unions of Beijing Forestry University.",加入这家公司的时候这个企业正处于风头浪尖上，由于我们公司在云南和海南大面积地种植桉树，所以当时遭到了绿色和平、地球之友、地球村等环保民间组织的强力的反对和抗议，也遭到了北京林业大学很多数高校学生社团的抗议。
Members of the Scientific Exploration and Outdoor Life club of Beijing Forestry University even put on their self-made vests with our trademark and a black cross on it and they boycotted our products in the supermarket.,这个北京林业大学山诺会呀，曾经穿上自己制作的马甲，在马甲上打上我们的商标，上面还加了个黑色的叉叉，到商场里去抵制我们产品的销售。
"When some women went to buy our products, they would stop them and say, ""Please don't buy it. It was made out of paper at the expense of primitive forest, at the cost of our environment.""",当有一些妇女去买我们的产品的时候，他就拉住她，说:“阿姨你别买这个产品，这个产品是破坏原始森林造出来的纸的，它是破坏环境的。”
"All-China Environment Federation(ACEF), the largest NGO featuring environmental protection in China back then, sent their powerful lawyers to Zhejiang to support Zhejiang Hotel Association in their law suit against my employer.",当初中国最大的环保民间组织，中华环保联合会还派出了强大的律师团，来到浙江的杭州支持浙江省饭店业协会和我们公司打官司。
My job was to handle those environment-related crises.,而我的工作就是来处理这些环境方面的危机。
"As a professional manager, I was pretty much an accomplished man.",作为一个职业经理人，当时我的工作应该是，怎么讲是有成就的。
I was often invited to lecture in many universities and I also invited lots of students enthusiastic about environmental protection to engage in social practice activities in our forestry bases.,我去了很多大学做讲座，我也每年暑假邀请大学的环保的积极分子到我们的林业基地去参加社会实践。
"I still remember, in October, 2006, ACEF hosted its Annual Meeting of Sustainable Development.",我记得2006年的十月份，中华环保民间组织可持续发展年会在北京召开。
The Scientific Exploration and Outdoor Life society of Beijing Forestry University delivered a speech named Heaven and Hell on behalf of their college counterparts.,而北京林业大学山诺会作为高校环保社的代表，当初发言的题目叫《天堂和地狱》。
They used to protest against us.,以前他们是反对我们的。
"However, after my public relation efforts, they changed their stances.",但是在我的公关，在我的这个宣传下，他们转变了立场。
"Another successful case is that I managed to change the stance of ACEF, turning them from our opponents, our protesters to our fellows and our supporters.",更一个成功的公关案例是，我改变了中华环保联合会的立场，从反对、抗议到理解、支持。
"ACEF published a long research report in the form of its internal publication named Led and Guided by Environmental Protection, Paper-Making Can Go Green, in which as a third party, it proved that our company, following closely the industry policies, had taken a path of circular economy.",中华环保联合会以它们内刊的形式出版了一期题目叫《生态引领，环保之家，绿色造纸》的长篇的调查报告，以第三方的身份帮我们证明，就说我们的企业是符合产业政策，是走循环经济之路的。
"But it was over its top and our public relation efforts had gone too far, attracting strong protests from multiple NGOs of environmental non-governmental organizations(ENGO).",但是这件事情动作太大了，就是我的公关有点儿过头了，导致了当时中国多家民间环保组织的强力的抗议。
"Liao Xiaoyi, a very famous environmental protectionist back then in China, also the head of Beijing Global Village,  resigned her directorship from ACEF to protest against us.",中国有一个非常有名的环保人士叫廖晓义，她是北京地球村的村长，当时就抗议，辞去了中华环保联合会理事的职务。
"However, one battle after another, despite all the victories against those NGOs, I wasn’t happy at all.",一个一个的战役打下来，每一次面对这些民间环保组织看似胜利的结果，我没有一点点成功的喜悦。
I had been thinking.,我在想。
"I worked as an environmental public relations specialist in this company, I was well paid and I stayed in 5-star hotels, I went on business trips by plane.",我到这个公司里来做环境公关，是我拿工资，我住在五星级酒店，我出差都是坐飞机。

But why were they so persistent?,可是他们又为了什么这么执着？
"I asked myself later, for what?",后来我想，他们是为了什么？
For themselves?,他们是为了他们自己吗？
"No, they did all these to protect our environment for all of us, including for me.",不是，他是为了我们的生态环境，是为了我们大家也包括我在内。
"At the end of 2006, I went back to Hangzhou, my hometown, to gather together with my former classmates.",2006年的年底，我要回老家杭州参加同学聚会。
"I started out my career as a journalist, and some of my classmates, also journalists, knew that I was enthusiastic about legal rights protection.",同学聚会的时候因为我是写新闻出身的，我的同学都是记者，以前知道我是维权英雄。
"So when they heard that I was then working as environmental PR in a company like that, they said to me in a joking tone, ""Yang Jianchu, how come you turned yourself from a hero of legal rights protection into a traitor?""",那一天吃饭听说我在这样一家企业里做环境危机公关，用开玩笑的口吻跟我讲，说：“杨建初，你怎么从维权的英雄变成了汉奸啦？”
I knew it was a joke but it made me feel really bad.,虽然是一句玩笑话，我听了以后心里很不是个滋味儿。
"I was, just like Jake Sully in Avatar, stuck in the conflict and confusion of the ideal and the reality, of my profession and the morality.",那时候我就像《阿凡达》中间的杰克·萨利，陷入了理想和现实，职业和道德的一种矛盾和困惑之中。
What should I do?,我该怎么办？

Here I am only to tell you one story that is not so far away from Shanghai.,我在这里只讲一个故事，这个故事离我们上海很近。
"We all know that Mr. Zhu Ziqing once wrote an essay called ""Qin huai River in the Paddle Sound"".",我们大家都知道朱自清先生有一篇散文叫《灯光桨影里的秦淮河》。
"I believe that the Qin huai River at that time was very clean, but you could go check out how the river looks like now.",我相信那时候的秦淮河是非常的干净的，可是在座的朋友你们现在去看一看，现在的秦淮河是怎么样子的。

Otherwise my children and my grandchildren will die.""",这个时候，一位曾经在这个工厂上过班的老职工站出来了，他脱下他的外套，跳到了他们的排污池里头，他说：“今天我说了大不了我死，但是我如果不说，我的孩子，我的孙子可能会死。”

"I need to settle down here, right here in Zhangjiajie.",我要在这里安家，我要把家安在张家界。
I would like to tell you another story.,在这里啊我要再插一个小故事。
"When my wife had just recovered, we moved first to Qingyuan, a little town in the suburb of Guangzhou instead of directly to Zhangjiajie.",当初刚开始的时候，妻子生病刚生好的时候，我没有在广州我也没马上搬到张家界，我搬到了广州郊区的一个小城市叫清远。
I'm not sure if all of you have heard of this city.,我不知道在座的有谁知道。
But the name of this city is very beautiful.,这个名字起得非常的美丽。
"The name ""Qingyuan"" reminds me of a clean river that flows afar.",叫清远，山水清远的清远。
It's 60 miles from Guangzhou and has the best hot spring and rafting.,它离广州六十公里，那里有最好的温泉和漂流。
It used to be the backyard garden of Guangzhou.,曾经是广州的后花园。
"So originally I thought since the environment and air in Guangzhou weren't that good, I could move to Qingyuan.",所以当初我在想，广州环境不好，空气不好，我就把家搬到清远吧。
"However, not long after we bought an apartment in Qingyuan, Guangdong government introduced a new policy called ""Empty the cage for new birds"".",谁知道刚刚在清远买了房子，没多久，广东省推行了一个政策叫 “腾笼换鸟”。
"""Empty the cage for new birds"" means moving some of the heavily polluting companies from the developed areas out to peripheral areas.",所谓的“腾笼换鸟”就是把一些经济发达地区的重污染企业搬出来，外移。
"Therefore those heavy polluters in Dongguan, Shunde and Foshan all were then moved to Qingyuan.",好啦，东莞、顺德、佛山那些污染的企业，这些污染的鸟都搬到清远来了。
"So later Qingyuan was surrounded by global waste treatment factory in the south, a cement factory in the north, a porcelain city in east and an electroplating plant in west.",所以后后来的清远变成了，南面是洋垃圾处理厂，北面是水泥厂，东面是陶瓷城，西面是电镀业。

"I want to guard the last piece of clean land and create a better home for not just myself, my family but also more people out there.",我希望守好这一块最后的净土，给我自己，给家人，给更多的人创造一个美好的家园。
"Many people asked me, ""Yang Jianchu, why did you give up your well-paid job in a foreign entreprise and choose to work for environmental protection instead?""",很多人问我：“杨建初，你为什么放弃外资企业的高薪不干，做环保了？ ”
"My answer is, ""I'm born to join the cause of environmental protection. As my mother's name is ""water"" and my father's is the earth and forest, I'm the son of water, earth and forest!""",我说：“我这命中注定要做环保的，因为我的母亲叫水珠，我的爸爸叫土林，我是水、土地和森林的儿子！”
Thank you!,谢谢大家！
Let's start with marital relations.,就让我们从婚姻关系开始。
"On a grand wedding, the mother of the bride talked on the stage to the sweet couple sincerely.",在一场盛大的婚礼上，新娘的母亲在台上对新郎新娘说了一番非常语重心长的话。
"""The two of you come from different family backgrounds with different habbits and now you became a family. I wish you hold each other's hands for a lifetime. Please keep in mind that the truth of marriage is to respect and tolerate your life partner because the equation of marrage is 0.5+0.5=1.""",她说：“你们两个人都来自不同的地方有不同的生活习惯，现在你们组成了一个家庭，那你就要知道未来的人术你们要执子之手，与子偕老；那你一定要知道，这个婚姻的真谛在于包容对方，婚姻是0.5+0.5=1。”
"Hearing her words, the guests may react just like you, ""She has surely learnt about the true significance of marriage from her own.""",讲完这番话以后，在座的宾客也许就像您听了这番话，你会说：“诶，多年的这个婚姻的这个经历者找到了婚姻的真谛。”
"But wait, is it true?",可是，等一等，这真的是真的吗？
"Does marriage really mean ""0.5 plus 0.5 equals 1""?",真的婚姻就是0.5+0.5=1吗？
I was whole in the first place.,我本来是一个完整的1。
"However, if tolerance in marriage means that we should turn from a whole person to a half, then why bother getting married when we can live a decent life alone in today's society?",如果包容是意味着把1变成0.5，那么在这个社会上我们已经不要婚姻都可以活的很好的情况下，我为什么还要进入婚姻？
"According to our study on intimate relationships,  ""0.5+0.5=1"" is an equation people made when marriage was considered as a life-time commitment that could not be broken.",那我们的亲密关系研究就告诉你，0.5+0.5=1是过去的我们把婚姻作为白头偕老不能破碎的最终目标这样一个过程的一个产物。
"However, now the significance of marriage lies in the happiness and growth people get in a marital relationship.",但如果今天我们认为婚姻很重要的意义是，我希望在婚姻里获得我的幸福，得到我的成长。
Therefore a healthy intimate relationship should be 1+1≧1.,那么好的亲密关系它一定是1+1大于等于1。
"Nevertheless, what the mother said made sense because we indeed have to deal with various kinds of differences with our partners.",可是这位妈妈也一点都没有讲错，因为我们的的确确必须要面对各种各样的差异。
"For instance, there are differences between men and women, between our parents and us, between our children and us.",举例来说，男人女人，呃父母这一辈跟我们这一辈，我们跟孩子都是有差异的。
A game women love most is the game of guessing.,我们女人最喜欢玩的一个游戏是一个猜猜猜的游戏。
"After being married for years, for every important holidays or our birthdays, our husbands will always ask what gifts we want for the occasion.",经过很多年的婚姻生活以后，每年重大的节日，我们的生日我们的先生都会问我们：“诶，今年你想要什么样的礼品？”
"""Up to you"" is our answer.",我们说：“随便。”
We never tell them our exact ideas for we want them to guess.,我们永远不告诉他，因为我们要猜。
But husbands know nothing of romance and always make the wrong guess.,我们的丈夫常常不解风情，他永远会猜错。
"We feel rather disappointed for we believe the ultimate love is when your partner gets you even if you don't say anything, that is love.",我们就觉得很失望，因为在我们女性心目中爱情的最高境界是：我什么都不说你都知道我，那说明你爱我。
"However, men are strange creatures with different way of thinking.",可是男人这个动物他很奇怪，他没有这种思维。
They argue that they couldn't have known since they cannot read your minds.,他说你什么都不说我怎么可能知道，我又不是你肚子里的蛔虫。
So these differences exist in our marriage life for years.,所以在婚姻生活里，因为这种差异在常年的婚姻里面。
"We think that our partner does not get us, we are frustrated at their behavior and we feel unloved.",我们因为觉得你怎么就这么不理解我，我就很受伤，你怎么能这样子做，我觉得你不爱我。
These differences take the toll to our marriage so we have to deal with them.,婚姻就变得青痕累累，所以差异的问题又必须是我们要去解决的。
"As I study anthropology, I find Fei Xiaotong has the best explanation for differences when he was conducting ethnical research.",那我自己做人类学，实际上我就觉得费孝通先生在做嗯民族研究的时候，总结了民族研究的几句话，我觉得这是对差异最好的诠释。
"And I quote, ""Appreciate the values of others as do to one's own and the world will become a harmonious whole.""",叫“各美其美，美人之美，美美与共，天下大同”。
"He came up with it when he studied China's ethnic groups, believing that each ethnic group should maintain its own values and aesthetical standards.",他是在做民族学的时候提出来的，他的理念是说：诶，各个民族都有自己的标准，价值标准跟审美取向。
"However, the values and aesthetical standards of one ethnic group may appear wrong even distasteful to another ethnic group.",常常在另外一个民族看来这种价值取向跟审美标准是错误的甚至是恶心的。
It is common that an aggressive ethnic group coerces another one to adaption in their early contact.,所以在民族接触的早期常常一个强势的民族会强迫另外一个民族去改变以来适应我。
"During the process, the frequent outbreaks of ethnic conflicts make it impossible for a harmonious coexistence among people.",在这个过程中，民族冲突就不断地爆发，人跟人之间就没有办法和谐共处。
"But then we would discover that, well, after multiple interactions between different ethnic groups, we would notice that although their aesthetical and value standards are different from ours, they have their own values.",这个时候我们就发会发现，啊，经过民族的多次的接触，我们会发现说，原来你的那些美、你的价值标准跟我不同，可是它也是有道理的。
"With further communication, it turns out that one day we start to appreciate the different dances and religious beliefs.",在更多的交流中我们会发现说，不仅是这样子的，原来有一天我发现说你的那些舞蹈、你的那些宗教信仰也是诶我也会喜欢的。
"As we constantly enhance the mutual understanding and communication, we start to respect and advocate different values, and appreciate the differences.",然后我们就不断地往这个进一步的理解沟通中间，我们达到了美美与共，我们开始欣赏这种差异。
"Due to the different values and cultural diversity, the world is getting more beautiful.",我们发现世界正是因为这种差异和多元才变得如此美好。
Only in this way can we respond to the call of the Communist Party of China to build a harmonious society.,然后我们才能真正实现我们党领导提出来的和谐社会。
We can also apply it in our family life for it works the same way.,这个理念用在家庭生活中，其实是一模一样的。
It is just easier said that done.,只是说起来容易做起来很难。
Let me take a few examples.,我们来讲几个例子。
"I bet you all know him, the hero of the most famous case of how-to-screw-over-your-father last year.",这位可能大家一眼就认出来了，这是我们去年年度最有名的坑爹事件的男主角。
He was a brilliant teenager with great artistic talent before the incident.,但他曾经是一个非常出色的少年，他的艺术才能非常的，展现的非常的好。
"Li Shuangjiang, his father, was very proud of his son's talent and shared in the show of A Date with Luyu.",他的爸爸李双江，有一次讲他的这个才能在鲁豫有约里面就说了。
"He said that, ""I have always wanted my son to grow up freely and have the power to love.",啊很骄傲地说，我一直希望我的孩子自由的成长，我要让他有爱的那个能量。
I gave him freedom so he could make great artisitic achievements.,我让他自由成长，所以他艺术才能表现得这么好。
"He said the mother was very strict and he disagreed with her, saying that only when the child was free to explore his artistic talent could he have a bright future.",他说他的妈妈就常常对他严格的要求，我跟他讲你这是错的，孩子只有自由发展他的艺术才能，才能够很好的发展。
"After things went wrong for Li Tianyi, the public unanimously blamed Li Shuangjiang for his parenting, accusing him of spoiling his son and claiming that he deserved it.",可是当有一天，李天一出了很多事情的时候，我们开始一窝蜂地说李双江你错了，因为你错了，所以他把你给坑了，因为你对孩子太宠爱了。
But let's think it all over.,可是我们回过头来想。
Isn't it right to give our kids the freedom to grow?,让一个孩子很自由的发展给他发展的空间，不是很对吗？
"As we all know, it's necessary for the kids to know the rules and be strictly guided to obey the rules in the process of growing up.",我们知道在孩子的成长过程中其实他既需要知道规则是什么，既需要有人很严格地告诉他你应该怎么做，其实这些规则是必须谨守的。
"In the meantime, it's necessary to give them free space to grow freely.",但同时他也需要另外一方面给他自由成长的空间。
Both educational methods are essential to the kids.,两个教育其实对一个孩子来讲都是需要的。
Spoiling is not necessarily wrong and strict education neither.,所以并不是说宠爱一定是不好的，并不是说严格教育一定是不好的。
"Therefore, going to extremes should be avoided.",走极端都是不好的。
Kids should be taught in both ways and the differences between the two educational methods should coexist.,可是对孩子来讲，两种的教育他其实都是需要的。
Obliteration and criticism against each other should be avoided.,这两种差异必须要共存不能互相的抹杀、互相的抨击。
That is what cherishing each other's values means.,但这就是各美其美的理念。
Let the differences be as they have the very season to exist.,我们要让差异存在，因为它一直是有理由存在的。
"But it's really hard to put it into practice, at least for me.",可是真的要做也很难的，我自己发现我在做的时候也很难。
Take a personal example.,我自己亲身的故事来讲。
"One day my daughter took back her math test from the primary school, I found her score was less than 80, the cut-off score.",我的孩子上小学的时候呃小学的时候拿了一份数学这个考试成绩回来，我一看她们学校80分是呃及格分数线，她80分都没到。
"I talked to her softly, ""Baby girl, let's find out together why you made mistakes and figure out how to correct them.""",那我就会跟孩子说：“诶宝宝，我们一起来分析一下为什么你错了，我们有没有什么方法去改正这些错误。”
I was satisfied with my amicable manner.,啊我非常和颜悦色，我觉得自己做得非常好。
Because I was good at parenting and didn't scold her.,因为我是在这方面的专家，我没有去批批评她。
Then my husband returned home.,这个时候我先生回来了。
"""Let me have a look at the test paper. I'm good at math."" He said.",他说：“诶，数学是我专长，孩子卷子给我看看”。
"He looked through the paper, ""This is a careless mistake, I see. It doesn't count"".",他说：“啊，这个题为什么错啊，是粗心，啊那不算错误。”
"""Why is the answer to this question wrong? Miscalculation? Can you work out the right answer? I bet you can. OK, it also doesn't count"".",“这个题为什么错，算错了，你能算得对吗？啊你肯定能算对，这也不算错误。”
"In the end, he claimed that her actual score was 99.",最后这张卷子他说其实你考了99分。
I wonder how he could let her realize her mistakes in this way.,啊，我就想了，这样子你怎么能让孩子知道她是错的呢？
But I knew I couldn't challenge him in front of our daughter because we approached parenting differently.,可是我也知道说我们两个不同，不能够在孩子面前说啊你就是错的。
So I just waited to check the outcome.,等一等，让我来看看效果。
It turned out that she had made constant improvement in math from then on.,结果我们的孩子数学成绩后来就一直在往上走。
"Because she had faith in herself, believing she could do better next time everytime she made mistakes.",因为她信心很足，她觉得每一次错，嗯，其实我可以做得更好。
"At that point, she need to find out the right answers, but most importantly, she needed to build up her confidence.",那一刻她既需要方法，但她可能更重要的是需要信心。
"So I figured the meaning of the saying ""the differences have the right to exist"" is that when others have different opinions, it is possible that they are right.",所以，我发现这个美人之美的意思就是说：其实别人的差异跟你不同的方法，他有可能是对的。
Just like dating is different from marriage.,就像我们谈恋爱跟结婚有不同一样。
"We are pleased to find out that our boyfriends are very generous, a loyal friend with many people around, but after we marry them, we start to complain about him not taking care of the family or being busy with business outside.",我们结婚之前发现我们的丈夫他是如此的这个大方，有哥儿们义气有很多朋友；结婚以后我们就说了你怎么不照顾家庭，你怎么有那么多的事外面的事情要去做。
Actually it was not their personalities but the scenarios that have changed.,其实只是一个特点发生在不同的场景。
"Before the marriage, husbands are proud of the pretty and submissive girlfriends, but after getting married, they feel exhausted by the over-dependent wives who can't do anything on their own.",我们结婚之前发现太太小鸟依人，什么都听你，你觉得又很漂亮你特别得意；结了婚以后你会发现说这个太太怎么这么不能干，什么都要依赖你，你很累。
Those are identical features in different scenarios.,同样是一个特点在不同的场景里面。
"Therefore, ""to appreciate others' values"" is to see the shining points of people.",所以美人之美是说更多的看到那个优点。
It is really hard to change people for it is a matter of personality.,其实你很难去改变一个人，因为这个是个特点的东西。
"If we just focus on the strengths of others, they will be encouraged to do better in the right areas.",你单单看到他的优点，那么他常常这个特点在合适的领域里就会更多的发生。
"In fact,  differences can bring us more benefits than we thought.",但实际上差异还会带来更多的好处。
I lived in the US for quite a long time.,我在美国生活了很长的一段时间。
"Despite the safe traffic there, I never gave a thought to driving on my own due to my poor sense of direction and bad driving skills.",那我自己因为是路盲开车技术不怎么样，我知道美国的这个交通非常好，可是我从来没有想法要去开车。
"Driving on the American highway, for me, was scary.",对我来讲，那个开着车在美国公路上，还是件挺可怕的事情。
"In the October of last year 2012, I and my husband went to Los Angeles to stay there for five days.",可是呢去年，两零一二年十月份我跟我先生去洛杉矶过五天。
"However, when we were in Los Angeles he told me that he needed to stay in San Francisco for 2 days.",中间有两天时间他说他要去旧金山一次。
"In my opinion, it would save more time by plane.",按我的想法那实在不行就飞机飞过去。
But he insisted on hiring a car and driving there.,他说不，他要租辆车开过去。
"It takes seven hours to drive from Los Angels to San Francisco, so it's 14 hours back and forth.",从洛杉矶到旧金山是七个小时，来回就是十四个小时。
"For me, driving for 14 hours in two days to finish the round trip was scary.",对于我来讲两天打一个来回，十四个小时太可怕啦。
I refused to go together but he insisted.,我说不我不要去，可是我先生说我要去。
"I gave in at last for he accompanied me in this American trip to attend a conference, so we hired a car and hit the road.",因为那次是他陪我去美国他陪我去开一个会，我想嗯他陪我了，那么我也做一个妥协吧，然后我们就租辆车上路了。
"To my surprise, the highway from Los Angels to San Francisco was such a feast to the eye.",结果，我发现从洛杉矶到旧金山那条公路是如此的美，非常漂亮。
I couldn't be more impressed.,给了我特别独特的感受。
"On the way, my husband shared with me his understanding of the US and the life, then I got to know his dreams and ideas.",在车上我先生也跟我讲说，他对美国的理解生活的理解，我也觉得说，啊原来有些梦想你的梦想是这样子的。
"If it hadn't been my husband, if there hadn't been the differences between us, I could never have tried things like this and I would thus miss those beauty in life.",如果没有我的先生，没有他跟我的差异，用我的人生，我永远不会有这样的尝试，我永远不会发现那样的美。
"Thanks to him who is different from me, I can embrace a world different from mine.",可是因为有他，他跟我不一样，所以我开始拥有两个世界。
"When we encounter problems, we can come up with two different solutions.",我们碰到问题的时候，有两个解决方案。
We offer our child two options.,我们给予孩子有两条路，说。
"We tell her that, ""Whenever you encounter a problem, mum may tell you to do like this and dad could say a different thing.""",诶你碰到任何一个问题，妈妈会说，诶这是可以这么做的，爸爸说可以那样子做。
"Our kid said, ""Ok, I have to think over those two options and figure out which one is better.""",孩子说，嗯，你们两条路我要综合一下，看怎么做是更好的。
Our life becomes extremely wonderful and interesting because of the differences.,我们的生活就是因为差异而变得特别特别的美好，特别特别的有意思。
That is the harmony after we appreciate the values of others and our differences.,这个就是美人之美之后的美美与共。
"At this stage, we would find out that a true intimate relationship is not defined by desperate love when we can't survive without each other.",啊，到了这个程度我们就会发现，真正的这个亲密关系，它的实质并不是说爱，并不是说没有你我活不下去。
"On the contrary, we should be able to live a better life without our loved one around.",而是说没有你我也可以活得很好。
Life is better when I am with you and I am better with you because you feel the same way.,但是有你我活得更好，我觉得自己更美好，因为有我你也会更美好。
Only then could an intimate relationship give out the positive vibes.,这个时候亲密关系的正能量就能充分的发挥出来。
For only when there is the power of love could we embrace the differences.,因为只有在亲密关系里有爱的能量，我们才愿意去处理这些差异。
Only when we constantly experience conflits could we figure out our bottom lines and how far we would compromise.,只有在亲密关系中我们不断地碰撞，才知道诶原来底线在这里，妥协在这里。
Only then could we discover the beauty of a harmonious relationship.,原来美在这里，原来和谐的关系是在那里。
We live on the one side and enjoy the grass the other side.,我们生活在此岸，同时我们又能感受彼岸的美妙的风景。
"From now on, let's learn to respect and appreciate the differences, to enjoy the diversified and beautiful life.",那就从今天开始，让我们学着去尊重差异，享受差异，感受多元而美好的生活。

The reason why Drucker is called the master of masters in management is that he taught management from the perspective of philosophy with the plainest language.,因为德鲁克被称为管理的大师的大师，是因为他用哲学的，用最通俗的哲学语言在讲管理。
"Instead of teaching the way to management people, he taught the principles behind management.",他没有教你怎么管人，但他讲的是管理的道理。

"He said: ""It's just a piece of cake.""",他说：“简单。”
"He said: ""If you go right over left for the first knot, then for the second knot, you should go left over right. The reason is that we basically tie the shoelaces in one direction, so you just need to make the knots in opposite directions.",他说：“你只需要系第一个扣的时候如果是右压左，返回来的时候你一定要左压右，因为我们基本上都是在一个方向上系，你只要两个方向正好相反。”
"I asked, ""How does it work?""",唉我说：“这为什么这样就可以了呢？”

It indicates the number of girls admitted from the 19th century until now.,它刻了从十九世纪一直到现在，招收女生的数量，啊。
"Although quite attractive at university, girls are depicted as people with miserable lives, and pretty girls are the cause of much trouble according to more than one writer.",其实女生呢在大学里面是非常有魅力，但是女生呢在很多的作家的文学作品当中呢，却命运啊常常不济，长的漂亮一点的人，大多说你红颜祸水。

He wondered whether the earth would be unstable if this was the case.,那如果是这样的话呢，那会不会地球就会很不稳定。
"Therefore, he made an assumption that there could be a landmass in the south pole of the earth and he called the landmass ""Antarctica"".",所以他据此猜测啊，会不会在今天的地球的最下面的这个位置，有一块陆地，他把这块陆地叫做Antarctica，叫南极。
"With this bold assumption, he deduced that there could be an ocean in the north pole of the earth to keep the balance, so he called it ""Arctic"".",那他做了那么个大胆的猜测之后，他觉得对应的在地球的整个的最上面的位置，也是为了地球的稳定，那就应该是一片汪洋大海，所以他把那个地方叫做北极。
"Almost all the major geographical discoveries in the southern hemisphere made over the subsequent 2,300 years were in close ties with this assumption of Aristotle.",所以两千三百年之内的几乎所有的重要的南半球的地理大发现，都跟亚里士多德的这个猜测有莫大的关系。
"About four years ago in 2011, a year marked human’s 100th successful treks to the South Pole, I really wanted to go to Antarctica that seemed to have a special appel to me.",两千一一年的时候，大概是四年前，正好是人类第一百次登上南极点，我就特别特别想去这个叫南极的地方，它对我有一种无比的一种感召力。

Where is the real antipode of China?,那我们真正的正背面在哪里呢？
"Actually, our real antipode is situated diametrically opposite to China and it is in South America.",真正的正对面是穿地心而过，其实是在南美洲。

How long was the flight?,要飞多久？
It would take two whole days.,要飞整整两天两夜。

"After buying the ship ticket and plane tickets, the next important thing was to apply for the visa.",买好了船票，买好了机票之后，下面一件重要的事情就是要去办一张签证。
"As the South Pole is not a country, tourists heading there have to land in Argentina first.",去办一张去往，南极不是一个国家，但是呢如果你要去南极，你可能首先得落地到阿根廷。

I didn't contact any travel agency in advance because I planned to go the Antarctica alone.,因为我是一个人去的嘛，所以说没有旅行社。
"So I called a travel agency and said, ""I want to go to Argentina. Can you help me get a visa?""",打电话给旅行社说：“我想去阿根廷，能不能帮我办一张签证？”

"I said, ""Then how did other people get there? So many have gone there, there's always a way. How did they get it?""",我说：“那以前那么多人怎么去的？这么多人去过阿根廷，总会有办法，他们是怎么去的？”
"The agency answered, ""They are group tourists, Argentina does not issue travel visas to individuals.”",他说：“他们都是团体，你是个人，阿根廷不开放个人旅游。”
But I've already bought the steamship ticket and the plane ticket.,但是我已经买好了船票，我已经买好了机票。
I can't drop this now.,我现在不能不去。
I must go.,我一定要去。
I have to go to Argentina and the South Pole.,我一定要去阿根廷，我一定要去南极。

"Yes, there was such a way.",原来这样也可以的。
"Then I went to the embassy and the visa officer asked me, ""What about the other people in the group?”",我就去到领事馆，签证官问我说：“诶，你们的其他人呢？”
I answered that everyone else canceled this trip and it was just me now. The travel agency decided to send me to Argentina as planned to keep their credibility.,哦那个其他人后来都退掉了，就我一个人为了保证旅行社的信誉，所以说就送他去去阿根廷。
"Finally, I got a visa and an air ticket to Argentina and a steamship ticket to the South Pole.",最后好不容易拿到了一张去阿根廷的机票、一张签证和一一个船票。
I was all set to depart from Shanghai.,准备从上海出发。
Then I thought that going to the South Pole was my dream and it might also be the dream of many people.,知道我要去南极呢，我现在想，去南极这个地方，是我的一个梦想，但同时可能也是很多人的梦想。

"The activity generated a lot of responses, a lot of people wanted to get the postcard and have it send to their loved one from the southernmost tip of the earth.",在微博上就立刻就很多人开始，就想我一定要得到这张明信片，从世界的尽头，全世界的最南端寄一张明信片给我最爱的那个人。
I limited the number of postcards at 100 considering my baggage volume.,我限制了一下啊，我怕我的行李箱不够装，所以我限制了一百张。
Why 100?,为什么要一百张呢？
"If one person donated 20 hours, how many hours would 100 people give out?",我算了一下，假如说一个人，捐献二十个小时，那一百个人是多少小时呢？
"I did the math and it would be 2,000 hours.",两千个小时。
If a person is expected to work for about 8 hours a day and there are 250 work days in a year.,一个人一年有250个工作日，一个工作日呢就是八个小时。
"Then 250 times 8 is exactly 2,000 hours.",250个工作日乘上八个小时正好是两千小时。
"In other words, if I really helped 100 people take their little dreams to the South Pole and post back to China, that means I hired someone to do charity works for the whole year of 2012.",也就是说如果我真的帮这一百个人，把他们的这个小小的梦想带到了南极，再寄回给中国的话，我就相当于雇了一个人，在2012年全年在做公益的事业。
"After receiving 100 postcards, I found that there were still many people who saw this activity on my Weibo.",收到了一百张明信片之后，很多人看到了我的微博。
"At that time, a lot of my friends called me and said, ""I heard that you're going to the South Pole?”",这个时候我突然之间发现，我的朋友很多，给我打电话说：“听说你要去南极？”
"I replied: ""Yes, so you know.""",我说：“是的，你也知道了。”
"""Em, can you bring me a penguin?""",“嗯，你能不能帮我带一只企鹅回来。”
"""Penguins are out of question.""",“企鹅是不可能了。”
"They said, ""Well, can you send a postcard?""",他说：“那你能不能帮我寄一张明信片？”
"I said, ""Okay, I will note down all your addresses.""",我说：“好吧，我帮你记下来，你的地址全都记下来。”
"With 100 postcard dreams and 400 requests from my friends, I finally went to the South Pole with 500 wishes.",最后呢就从那一百张明信片，又加了整整四百个朋友的要求，我就带了五百个愿望，去南极。
"However, it seemed unlikely to buy 500 postcards in Argentina and then write the addresses.",可是，你这个时候已经没有办法去到阿根廷，去到当地去买五百张明信片，然后呢再去写地址。
"It may take two days and two nights or more to write all addresses, let alone writing greetings.",光是写地址这件事情就能，就能让你写不完，两天两夜可能都写不完这个地址，更不要说去写祝福。
So I designed a postcard by myself and turned to a printing house in Shanghai.,那我就在上海找了一个印刷厂，自己设计了一张明信片。
"Before that, I had consulted relevant Argentine authorities by phone, ""Is there any rule in Argentina that only postcards produced by local post offices can be sent out?""",打电话到阿根廷说：“你们的明信片有没有说是要贵国的邮政局监制的？”
They replied that postcards of all formats could be sent out from Argentina.,他没有，你的明信片，只要是明信片格式都可以寄。
So I printed 500 postcards in China and asked the printing house to print the addresses on them.,我就在中国印了五百张明信片，印的时候呢我要求这个印刷厂在每一张明信片上都印上了我写好的地址。
This helped me save the time to write addresses.,全都是印好的，所以我就省掉了去写地址这个环节。
"But the greeting words cannot be printed, as it would a print instead of a postcard.",可是，祝福的话你是不可能印上面的，因为你把祝福的话也印在上面的话它就不是一张明信片了，它就是一个印刷品。
So I left the space for greeting words blank.,所以说祝福的那一段都是空着的。
"Eventually, I boarded the plane with 500 postcards.",我就带着五百张名片上了飞机。
How long it would take to get from Shanghai to Argentina?,我从上海出发到阿根廷要多久来着。
"Tow days and two nights, right?",要两天两夜对不对？
So what will I do on the plane in such a long time?,两天两夜干什么？
Writing greeting words.,就在那儿写啊写啊。
"I had to be very careful, for perhaps some of the people who receive my postcards know each other and it would be embarrassing if they found the greetings on their postcards were the same.",你还得防备着，因为，说不定你的这个朋友认识你的那个朋友，你这两个祝福如果写的完全一样的话那也不行的。
So the greeting words should be different.,所以一定要差异化。
I racked my brain for two days and one night and finally finished all the postcards when the plane landed.,所以绞尽脑汁写写写写，整整写了两天一夜，落地的时候明信片终于把所有的祝福都写完了。
My biggest gain from this was that my handwriting was greatly improved.,我最大的收获就是，我的字比原来好看了很多。
"As soon as the plane landed in Argentina, I visited the post office at the southernmost tip of the world, the end of the world we talked about.",到了阿根廷一落地我就带着我的明信片就去了那个全世界最南端的那个邮局，我们说世界尽头的那个邮局。
"Opening the office door, I took out 500 postcards and put them on the desk, the officer handed me the postmark stamp and asked me to stamp them by myself.",推开门把我的名信片五百张掏出来往那个桌上一放，邮局就把邮戳递给了我，这时候你得自己盖。
Well China is populated and I guessed that he had never seen someone 500 postcards so he gave me the postmark stamp.,中国还是人多，估计从来没有见过一个人带了五百张明信片，他就把邮戳递给了我。
"I stamped each postcard, but you know, it takes time for postmarks to dry.",我就拿着邮戳一张一张一张一张地把它盖好，可是，邮戳你们知道盖好的明信片它不会立刻就干掉的。
So I can’t stack these postcards together so that they will dry themselves.,它不能也摞在一起，因为它慢慢才会干掉。
"So I had to put them on the floor, one postcard, two postcards, three postcards and finally the floor of the post office was covered by 500 postcards heading to China.",我就只好在邮局的地板上铺开了明信片，一张两张三张，把五百张明信片铺得整个邮局的地上全部都是寄往中国的明信片。
I put all of them in the mailbox and sent them back to China with 500 dreams they carried.,最后把它全部都塞到了邮箱里面，把这五百个小小的梦想，寄回了中国。
"At 3 o’clock in the afternoon, I arrived at the dock.",下午三点钟的时候我去码头。
"There was really a steamship waiting for us, so I boarded the Noah's Ark.",发现那边真的有一艘船在等我们，我上了那艘我们的诺亚方舟。
"After we were on board, all our passports were taken away because we were going to a place without any country.",上了我们的船之后呢，我发现原来我们把所有的护照全部都收走啦，因为我们要去一个连国度都没有的地方。
"Then the team leader told us that there were 99 tourists on the steamship, from 14 countries including the United States, Brazil, the UK and Finland, I was the only Chinese.",护照全部都收走之后领队告诉我们说这艘船上啊，一共有99位客人，这99位客人来自于十四个国家，来自于美国、巴西、英国、芬兰等等一共十四国家，中间只有我一个是中国人。
I thought what an interesting trip it would be.,后来我就在想这是一件多么有趣的旅行。
"Everyone here, regardless of where he came from, Finland, Canada or Brazil, must had interesting experiences.",因为，每一个人他一定都有他特别有意思的经历，不管他是从芬兰过来，还是从加拿大过来，还是就在巴西过来。
He must have gone to a lot of places before he decided to go to the South Pole.,他一定是去了很多地方之后才会想到有一天我要去南极这个地方。
Few people would go to the South Pole when they have not yet been to Nanjing first; few people would go explore the ocean beyond when they have not yet been to Shanghai; fewer people would go to a continent where there is no country when they have not yet stepped out of their country in their lifetime.,很少有人说是这辈子连南京都没去过，就要去南极，说没去过上海就去那么远的海上，说都没出过国门就要去那个连国家都没有的地方。
So I started chatting with them.,所以我就跟他们开始聊天。
"There was an American guy who was very interesting, he lived in San Francisco,",中间有一个美国的小伙子特别有趣，他住在呃三藩市，住在San Francisco，他住在这个城市。
"He told me one day he found that his job was terribly boring, so he decided to go on a trip.",他跟我说，有一天他觉得他的工作特别地无趣，很没有意思，他决定出去旅行。
But he had no idea about where to go.,旅行去哪里呢。
He pointed casually on the map and planned to go wherever he pointed at.,他说随便，那随便是去哪里呢，就在地图上随便指。
"Unintentionally, he pointed at the South Pole.",他随便指随便指一不小心指到了南极。
So he bought a ticket from San Francisco to Argentina.,于是就买了一张机票，从三藩就飞到了阿根廷。
It is relatively easier to fly from North America to South America and to get a visa.,从北美飞到南美要相对容易很多，而且签证也容易。
He paid just 100 USD for a 10-year visa to Argentina.,他付了一百美元就得到了阿根廷的十年的签证。
"After he arrived in Ushuaia, he pushed open the door of a local cafe and decided to earn some money there.",落地了阿根廷的乌斯怀亚之后，就推开了一个咖啡馆的门，就决定要进去打工。
Not all americans are rich and he had no extra money for the steamship ticket after paying for the plane ticket.,因为并不是每一个美国人都非常有钱，他支付了机票就没有钱去支付那张船票。
"While working in the cafe, he was waiting for ""a last minute ticket"".",就在咖啡馆打工，一边打工一边在等着一个叫最后一分钟船票：last minute ticket.
What is the last minute ticket?,什么叫最后一分钟船票呢？
There are always people around the world who have bought tickets but cannot get to Ushuaia for various reasons.,就是总会有人有各种各样的原因在全世界各地没有办法赶到乌斯怀亚，买了票但是来不了，总会有那么一两张的船票是最后是没有办法有人来的。
Local boatmen will put the last minute tickets on their windows.,所以说每天的早上，当地的船家就会把那个叫最后一分钟船票的东西贴在了那个窗户上。
Many globetrotting backpackers who couldn't afford the expensive ticket would arrive in Ushuaia earlier to grab the last minute tickets.,就会有很多的国际背包客就早早地就来到了乌斯怀亚，他们没有办法去支付昂贵的船票，它们就去抢那张最后一分钟船票。
"If the ticket was originally priced at 9,000 dollars, the last minute ticket may cost only 2,000 or 3,000 dollars.",这张船票原来假如说是九千美元，可能最后一分钟船票呢只有两三千美元。
So there will be many people waiting for such tickets every day.,所以每天就会很多很多人很多人就在去抢这张船票。
"Fortunately, this American guy got one.",终于给这个来自美国的小伙子抢到了。
"Not long after he boarded the steamship, he met an Australian girl.",抢到之后呢上了船，很快，就跟一个澳大利亚的小姑娘。
Suddenly I thought it was like a movie scene.,我突然之间觉得这好像是某一部电影的场景。
"We were going to a place full of icebergs, so we hurried to check if there were enough lifeboats on the steamship.",于是我们赶快去检查船上有没有足够的救生艇，因为我们要去一个，充满了冰山的地方。
How long would it take to get to the Antarctic continent from Ushuaia?,上了船还要多久才能到南极大陆呢？
Another two days and two nights.,还要整整两天两夜。
"Starting from Ushuaia, Argentina, the southernmost city in the world, the steamship sailed for two whole days and crossed the Drake Passage.",从阿根廷的乌斯怀亚，全世界最南端的那个城市，还要坐船两天两夜，穿过一个叫做德雷克海峡的地方。
The Drake Passage is the most treacherous waterways on the planet.,德雷克海峡是全世界最艰险的海峡。
"It spans the distance between the South America and Antarctica, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",它是大西洋跟太平洋的交界处，它是南美洲跟南极洲的交界处。
"It is also the place where cold currents and warm currents meet, making it difficult for many ships to pass through.",它也是冷流跟暖流的汇集地方，所以会有很多的船呐，它根本就穿不过。
There were circumstances when the ships could not get through the Drake Passage so they had to sail back.,会有一些船根本就穿不过德雷克海峡，最后又返回去的，都会有这样的情况。
"After a two-day voyage, we finally reached the Antarctica.",经过了整整的两天的航行，最终我们到达了这个叫南极的地方。
So how long does it take in total to get to the Antarctica from Shanghai.,也就是说从上海出发一共要多久才能到南极大陆呢？
At least four days and four nights before you reach the Antarctica.,至少要四天四夜，才能到南极大陆。
"After I set foot on Antarctic, I shot a beautiful video that I just played.",踏上南极大陆之后我就用我的相机，拍下了刚才那一段非常美丽的视频。
I can say that Antarctica is the most beautiful place I have ever seen.,南极是我见到的，可以说是最美的地方。
"After returning to Shanghai, I decided to write down some of my feelings.",从南极回到上海之后，我就把我的一些感受，决定把它写下来。
"One editor, after reading several of my articles, encouraged me to write a book about the experience.",写了几篇文章之后，有一个编辑他建议我说要不要考虑把这段感受，写成一本书。
I said it was a good idea.,我说这是个好想法。
So he recommended a publishing house.,于是呢他就推荐了一个呃出版社。
"After taking with the publishing house, my book 2012, Buy A Ticket to the South Pole was published.",我与出版社沟通一下，沟通完之后呢，我就出了一本书叫做《2012买张船票去南极》。
"The book had first printed 25,000 copies.",这本书出了首印两万五千册。
It sells well.,它出完之后卖得很好。
"After collecting my royalty fee, I suddenly realized that my trip to the South Pole didn't cost me a dime.",卖得很好之后突然之间发现，诶，收了版税之后我突然间发现，原来我去南极没花钱。
"If the book had sold better, I would have the money to go to the North Pole.",如果这本书卖得再好一点的话，连去北极的钱都有了。
This inspired at once my desire to go to the North Pole.,这就立刻激发了我，想去北极的愿望。
How can I get to the North Pole?,怎么样才能去北极？
The North Pole is completely different from the South Pole.,北极跟南极完全不同。
The South Pole is on a continent and our goal was to embark the landmass while the North Pole is located in the vast ocean.,南极是一块陆地，我们以踏上那块大陆为一个标志，可是北极呢，是一片汪洋大海。
"Although some countries have land masses within the Arctic Circle, such as Canada, Greenland, Finland, etc., the middle of the North Pole is a stretch of sea.",虽然有一些国家有一些陆地是在北极圈以内的，像加拿大、格陵兰岛、芬兰等等，但是呢北极的中间，越往中间、越往中间的位置是一块儿海洋。
So where exactly is the North Pole?,所以你到底要去哪里叫做去北极？
I don't think that setting foot on these land masses means a visit to the North Pole.,我想，去到那些陆地，并不能真正的代表北极。
"And the place I really want to go is right in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, I want to go to the real North Pole.",我想去到的那个地方，就是整个北冰洋的正中间，我想去到的那个地方叫做北极点。
But how can I get there?,可是怎么才能去到北极点呢？
The vicinity of the North Pole is covered by thick ice fields throughout the year.,北极点附近终年是被厚厚的冰原所覆盖的。
How can I get to the North Pole?,怎么才能去到北极点？
I looked it up on the Internet again.,我就又去上网去研究。
"This time, I found a Chinese website named Tripolers, a company founded by Mr. Qu Xiangdong, one of my old friends.",这一次，我看到一个中国的网站，叫做“极之美”，是我的一个老朋友曲向东老师的一家公司。
"Then I contacted Mr. Qu and said, ""Hey, I just learned that you can organize trips to the North Pole. Can I go with you? Can you give me a discount?""",我就去联系曲老师曲老师说：“诶，原来你可以组织去北极点，我能不能跟你一起去，你能不能给我打一个折？”
"He replied, ""I have read your book, 2012, Buy A Ticket to the South Pole. If you write another book about the trip to the North Pole, I will give you a free steamship ticket.”",曲老师说：“我看过你的《2012买张船票去南极》，如果你再写一本去北极的书，这张船票，就送给你啦。”
"I was so excited when I heard that and I said, ""Great, I'm in.""",我听到之后特别的兴奋，我说太好了，我要去。
I found another publishing house and said that now I had a ticket to the North Pole and I planned to write a best seller next.,我就去找到了，另外一家出版社，我说，我现在有一张去北极点的船票，下面我要做的事情是我要写一本畅销书。
What makes a book a best seller?,那什么叫畅销书？
"Han Han once said a book having over 30,000 copies was a best seller.",韩寒以前说一本书印3万册以上，叫做畅销书。
"I asked if the publisher could print 30,000 copies of my book at the first print.",我说你能不能给我这本书第一次印刷就印刷3万册。
"Because if so, my book could be a best seller from its debut.",所以就标志着它从它出生开始就是一本畅销书。
He said that he needed to read the book I wrote before at first.,他说我要看一看你原来的那本书。
"After reading it, he thought it was feasible and informed me to sign the contract.",他就看完这本书后觉得写得不错，他说好，我给你来签约。
Then I told Mr. Qu that I signed the contract and I could go with him to the North Pole.,我就拿着这个签的这个约，回过头来，告诉曲老师，说我拿到了书约，现在我可以跟你一块儿去北极点。
"Before setting off to the North Pole, I was thinking that when I went to the South Pole, I sent postcards to 500 people, right?",可是去北极点的时候，我在想我去南极的时候做了一件事情就是我给五百个人寄了明信片对不对？
100 of them got a postcard by doing charity works.,其中一百个人是做公益事业而得到这张明信片。
Shall I do the same for my trip to the North Pole?,去北极我要不要也做同样的事情？
Should I help those 100 people complete their postcard collection of both the North Pole and the South Pole?,我要不要让那一百个人能够集齐去南极和北极的两张明信片呢？
I thought it was of great meaning for them.,我觉得这对他们来说是个非常有意义的事情。
"So, I launched a new activity on Weibo.",我就在微博上发起了一个新的活动。
I said that I would send a postcard from the Norh Pole for people who would donate 24 hours in 2013 to charity works.,我说谁愿意在2013年，一年中间愿意捐献24个小时给公益事业的话，我就帮你也寄一张。

This activity also attracted many participants.,后来就很多很多人，就非常踊跃地反馈了。
"However, it was a large expenditure to print and mail 1,000 postcards.",可是这一千张明信片，加上邮费，加上印刷费，是一笔非常不小的开支。
"So I brought the 1,000 postcards to an outdoor jacket manufacturing company.",我就去拿着这一千张明信片的这个东西去找到了一家做冲锋衣的公司。
"I told them, ""Now some people are willing to do charity works. We can take these postcards to the North Pole to fulfill their charity dreams. Could you help us financially? ”",现在有，这一些人他愿意，带着这些明信片去到北极点，我们可以兑现这些人的一个公益的梦想，我想请你来赞助这件事情。
"The company spoke highly of this activity and sponsored all my expenses on this trip, including the money for printing and mailing these postcards, my tickets and other costs.",得到了这家公司非常好的一个认可，结果明信片的钱和我的机票和其他的所有的费用，全部都被家公司赞助掉了。
"Therefore, going to the South Pole and the North Pole is nothing remarkable.",所以去到南极和北极，没什么了不起。
What's remarkable is that we can help others turn their dreams into reality at no cost.,了不起的不是这些事情，而是我们能够同时去帮助别人去实现一些他们的梦想，并且呢最后还没有花钱。
"What I’m trying to tell you is that life is an unexplored, unexpected trip.",我想告诉大家的是，人生啊它就是一场，没有经过设计的、突如其来的旅行。
You will never know what you are going to do next.,你不知道你下一步到底要做什么。
"I didn't expect the trip to be free before I went to the South Pole, nor did I expect to go to the North Pole after my trip to the South Pole.",我去南极之前并没有想过这趟旅程是一个免费的旅程，并没有想过我去完南极之后，还要再去北极。

Thank you all.,谢谢大家。
"Today I’d like to talk about the story of children, especially the way my daughter and I traveled.",今天想讲的呢，是一群孩子，特别我想讲一下我跟女儿一起走过的这段路。
"Six years ago, lots of people traveled this route, including many of my friends.",那是在六年前，因为当时已经有很多的朋友，很多的队员走过这条路了。
"But no child had ever taken it, so it occurred to me that I wanted to take my daughter with me, as she liked to follow me everywhere when she was very little.",但是那时候还没有孩子走过，诶，我就想到带着我的女儿，因为我女儿从小跟我也到处跑。

"She said, ""I don't want to be the last in the team, but I am every day.""",她说：“因为我不想当最后一个，可是我每天都是最后一个。”
"I said, “It’s reasonable, there are only two children in this team, and you are the younger one.”",我说：“这很正常啊，因为只有两个孩子，你是最小的那个。”
"“But I hate the feeling of being last,” my daughter said.",她说：“但是我实在是不喜欢最后一名的感受。”
"“Then I will accompany you tomorrow, we will try to walk as fast as we can, and we won’t be last.”",我说：“好，那明天爸爸带着你走，我带着你走，我们不做最后一名，争取往前冲。”
She felt excited and said “Okay”.,她说：“好”，很高兴的。

We’ve lost the day’s walk even though we haven’t started yet.,还没出发呢，输在起跑线上了。
"When it came to her trust in me, I felt I had to treat the matter seriously.",我一听我说这个事儿非常严重，我说牵扯到女儿对爸爸的信任问题。
"So I made up my mind and told her, “No matter what happens today, we will not be last, and we’ll at least try to be second to last.”",于是我下定决心，我说今天无论如何我都让你不当最后一名， 哪怕是倒数第二。
"I explained to her, “Well, today our trick is to ‘walk slowly but never stop’. I believe as long as we keep walking and take no rests when others do, we will certainly not be the last.""",于是我就跟她讲，我说：“好，咱们今天的策略叫‘不怕慢就怕站’，我们就不停，我们就慢慢地走，别人休息我们不休息，我相信我们一定不会是最周这个最后一名。”

"Later I decided that we would rest for 5 minutes after an hour’s walk, and then continued to walk on and on.",后来自己定了个规则，大概走一个小时休息五分钟，然后就不停地往前走。

"Then we and the team took breaks successively, and after a while my daughter said to me, “Dad, let's go.”",我们跟那个大部队交叉停下来休息，然后休息了一会儿，我我这个我女儿又说，说：”爸爸，赶紧往前走吧。”
"""Don’t be hasty, we have already caught up, so there’s nothing to be worried about,” I replied.",我说：“着什么急，咱已经追上来了，没事儿。”
"“No, I cannot walk quickly enough, so if we rest longer, I am afraid I won’t be able to catch up,” she insisted.",她说：”不行，我走得慢，如果咱再歇一会儿，我又跟不上了。”
"Then I realized that she really cared about this, so we marched on.",我一听，我说这孩子怎么还很重视这件事儿，于是我就跟她一块走，我们就出发了。
"This is a picture taken by someone else when we almost arrived at the terminal point, where we found that we were among the first half of the team to make it to the destination.",这是我们快到终点的时候，有一个人出来给我们拍了张照片，我们非常高兴地发现我们居然是在整个队伍的前半部分抵达的终点。

"“I could not make it to the end today without my daughter,” I said.",我就感慨地说了一声，我说：“今天我走下来完全是因为我女儿。”
"Then my daughter said to me without even raising her head, “Actually I made it all because of my dad.”",这时候我女儿头都没抬地跟我来了句说：“其实我走下来也是因为我爸爸。”
"I can tell you now, what I felt at that moment was like hearing the collapsing of the wall in my heart.",我当时心里头的感觉，跟大家讲，一点不夸张地讲，心里头的感觉啊，就好像你耳朵里能听到那个心里头那堵墙“哗”就倒掉了。
"From that day on, I felt that there were no more misunderstandings between me and my daughter.",我从那天开始我就觉得我跟我女儿之间再也没有任何的隔阂。
Perhaps I still won’t have much to say when we are together the next time.,可能我们以后在一块儿的时候，我依然是没有任何话讲。
"But I reckon when people keep silent being together, odds are that either they feel awkward, don’t know what to say, or they feel delighted and don’t feel the need to express it.",但是我想人和人在一起，如果是沉默的状态，其实只有两种可能：一种可能他们很尴尬，不知道该说什么；另外一种可能，他们很幸福，不需要用语言表达。
I believe we were the latter.,我想我们是后者。
This episode may have just been progress in our parent-child relationship.,但这件事呢，其实可能是只是感情上的一个小突破。
"But I think it was a memorable experience, because it led to something valuable three years later after the walk.",但真正让我从理智上认为它是一件值得纪念的事，是在那个三年之后，走过这次戈壁的三年之后。

Three years later we did hold one—the first coming-of-age ceremony in the Gobi Desert.,那么三年之后，我们正式地搞了一届，可以说是第一届正式的大的戈壁成人礼。
"We expected to receive at least fifty children and their parents, with more than a hundred people in total.",有五十多个孩子，连上他们的父母大概有一百多人。
"When my daughter heard the news, she insisted that she come too.",我女儿听到这个消息的时候说：“我一要定去。”
She was already fourteen then.,那时候她已经将近十四了嘛。
"I must attend, she said.",她说：“我一定要去。”
"""Well, then come and join us,"" I told her.",我说：“好啊，你就过来吧。”
"I was curious about her intentions, however.",但是我也很奇怪你为什么要来。
"Walking in the Gobi Desert, in my opinion, is a rather painful experience.",因为我觉得走戈壁是件很痛苦的事情。
"Then four days later—four arduous days—all of the children shared their experiences with us, including my daughter, and what she shared was very touching to her mother and me.",结果同样的四天，同样艰苦的四天走完之后，我们的孩子们在台上一起分享，我女儿也在台上，她说了一段话，让我和她妈妈在底下听得非常感动。
"She said, “Actually this time my walking in the Gobi Desert is a gift that I am going to present to my parents”",她说：“其实我今天来，是为了用我走路这件事儿，给我的爸爸妈妈送一个礼物。”
"“When I first came here three years ago, my dad told me that he would hold a coming-of-age ceremony here.”",她说：“因为三年前我第一次走戈壁的时候，我爸爸跟我讲他要组织一个戈壁成人礼。
"“Three years passed, and now we have more than fifty children with us.”",“今天三年以后了，我看到已经有五十多个孩子来走这条路了。”
"""Wenchuan suffered a catastrophic quake two years ago,"" she continued, ""and my parents intended to organize a voluntary relief team when they watched the news with tears in their eyes.""",两年前，正好是汶川地震，她说，我爸爸妈妈看着电视流泪的时候就说，说我们想组织一个志愿救援队。
“Now it’s already two years since the foundation of this voluntary team.”,她说，现在这个救援队已经两周年了。
"“One year ago,” she said, “my parents talked about a 10km run for health concerns, so they called up their friends and then went jogging 10km every week.”",“一年前”，她说，爸爸妈妈商量说要做一个十公里健康走，就号召我们身边的朋友们运动起来，每周跑一个十公里。
"“A few days ago, we just celebrated the first anniversary of this running initiative.”",她说：“就在前不久，前几天，我们刚刚一起庆祝了十公里健康走一周年。”
"“Although we are together every day, I find my parents are quite busy, and they let me do whatever I want.”",她说：“我在爸爸妈妈身边，我发现他们很忙，整天也不管我，和放羊一样带着我。”
This was a complaint.,这是控诉。
“Now I finally realize what they were busy doing and that they will always keep their word.”,“但是，我今天终于知道了他们在忙一些什么，我也终于知道了他们的承诺，他们都会兑现 。”
"I felt moved; then it struck me that although our child is silent and rarely talks, she is always watching us.",这个事儿让我非常地感动，我这时候才知道其实孩子在身边非常沉默的，什么也不说的，她都在盯着你 。
"Our school advocates the motto of, “Belief, Action and Persistence”.",我们学堂之中有一句口号叫做“理想、行动、坚持”。
"I can find no better case to practice this motto than walking in the Gobi Desert  together with your child, or fulfilling a tough task together and making a promise to her and keeping your word.",我相信没有任何一件事，能够比和这个孩子一起去完成走戈壁这样一件事儿，或者去完成一个艰难的任务，并且跟她发出承诺，并且完成它，更能够体现这句话。
"Despite that it’s already been three years, I’d like to say to my daughter that we will continue to do those three things we promised, and see them become better and better.""",其实离这件事儿过去又三年了，我其实特别想跟我女儿讲，我们承诺的这三件事，我们依然在做，而且做得更好。
"I also believe that in the future my daughter can properly put into practice the motto of, ""Belief, Action and Persistence"".",我也相信我女儿未来也会把这个“理想、行动、坚持”更好地放到她的生活里。
That's the first thing I want to share with you.,这是我想跟大家分享的第一件事。
"In fact, children always surprise us in one way or another.",其实孩子有很多让我们意外的地方。
Here is a question for you.,比如说我问大家一个问题。
"Among our walkers who had been to the Gebi, we have kids from seven and a half years, the youngest, to eighteen, young people in their twenties, and people above forty .",你们觉得如果我们从我们走过戈壁的最小的是七岁半的孩子，然后到十八岁这个年龄段的孩子，就是 “孩子”统称为；然后青年人，二十多岁的青年人；再加上四十岁以上。
Are we middle aged?,我们算中年人吗？
I prefer to say that we are still young.,中青年吧哈。
So which age group do you think was most likely to cover the entire route without a ride?,四十岁以上的朋友们，四十岁以上到老年人，这三个阶段，你们觉得哪一个阶段的，哪一个阶段的人完整地走下来戈壁，不放弃、不上车的比例是最高的？
Which one?,嗯？
The middle aged?,中青年？
Kids?,小孩儿？
"Yes, it was them.",对，孩子。
"When I raise this question, you may suppose that young men would definitely have the most satisfying performance.",其实我问这个问题的时候，大家就应该不意外，因为正常的思维你一定会觉得年轻力壮的小伙子们是最好的。
"I found during my first walk, however, that less young men in their twenties could make it than those in their forties.",但是我们第一次走戈壁的时候，我就发现二十多岁的人走完全程的比例低于四十岁以上的人。
"I thought maybe this was because those in their forties have experienced a lot in their lives, so they could bear more pressure and suffering and hold on to the end.",当时我们的理解是觉得，可能是因为四十岁以上的人生活经历多了，能够承受的压力和苦难多了，所以他走下来了。
I came across a strange phenomenon in our first coming-of-age ceremony—the one attended by my daughter.,可是我们做了第一届戈壁成人礼，就是我女儿第二次参加的这次，我就有一个意外的发现。
"At the end of the first day’s journey, the guide told me, “It’s very strange, I have walked this route so many times, yet this is the only day that all the members walked to the end without taking a ride. I guess we have set a record.”",因为第一天走完戈壁，我们收队的这个队员就跟我讲，说很奇怪，说今天我创了个记录，说我们走了这么多次了，唯一的一天所有人都没有上车，都走下来了。
That day the children walked with their parents.,那一天是孩子、父母一起向前走。
And it was to our great surprise that all of the children were so persistent.,嗯？当时我们觉得这很意外，孩子们走得很好啊。
"On the following two days, those children walked by themselves.",第二天第三天是孩子们自己独立向前走，自己组队向前走。
"And when the second day came to an end, our guide told me just like he did the last time, “All the children walked to the end, and no one took rides, except for their parents.”",到第二天收队的时候，我们这个收队的同事又跟我讲，今天孩子们依然没有上车，全都走下来了，爹妈们上车了。
"It was easier to figure out why parents took rides, maybe because they wanted to arrive early and put up tents for their children.",我觉得爹妈上车可以理解，因为他们急着到营地给孩子扎帐篷去。
This was totally acceptable.,可以接受，可以理解。
I couldn’t see the reason why the children didn't take rides.,孩子们不上车，还有点儿没理解。
Later I realized that children recover from fatigue very quickly.,当然我后来发现还孩子们恢复得很快。
"Some of them would cry due to the long journey, but shortly after arriving at the camp, they would become playful again.",到了营地过一会儿，有的孩子到了营地走得直哭，但到了营地过了一会儿就好了，开始玩儿去了。
So I thought it’s no wonder that they didn’t take rides.,我就想可能是因为孩子自然恢复的快，没什么可奇怪的。
"On the third day, a child took a ride due to physical reasons, and a girl attended to her.",但是第三天有一个孩子因为身体的原因上了车了，另外一个女生呢就陪着她一块儿上了车。
"That night, the children sat together to share their stories, and the one who took a ride said, “To tell you the truth, today I met a member who felt uncomfortable, so she got in the car, and I also felt very tired. So I said to myself why not get on, too?”",到了晚上 ，孩子们坐到一块儿分享，结果这个上车的孩子呢就说到这件事，就说哎呀，非常难过地讲，说今天我确实因为谁谁谁不舒服，她想上车了，我一想哎呀，我也特别累，我说我陪着她吧，我们就一块儿上了收容车？
"Then I heard the crowd respond in astonishment, “Huh? We can ride that car?”",这时候我就听见周围这帮孩子们，噢？原来还可以上车啊？
"All of a sudden, I realized that they didn’t even know that they could get in the car.",我恍然大悟，原来他们是不知道可以上车。
I also found out why these three categories performed as they did.,但是我随即又解开了一个谜，我就知道为什么刚才我说的这个数字会有这样一个分布。
"For the children, they didn’t ride the car because they didn’t know that they could.",孩子们之所以不上车是因为他不知道有上车这个选择。
They thought that the only choice for them was to walk to the end.,他认为只有一个选择就是我要走下来。
"As for those in their forties, they might have conceded that they have lived nearly half of their lives, and with few choices left, this was it—walk to the end and finally achieve something.",四十岁以上的人之所以不上车，是因为他也知道，我四十多岁了啊，我这辈子没有太多的选择了，就这样吧，好好干，干成了我这辈子就行了。
"Or, if not, yield to fate.",干不成这辈子也就这样了。
So they were unwilling to try other choices.,所以四十岁的人他潜意识当中他不会再愿意做更多的选择。
Only those who were young in their twenties and freshly graduated from university had many chances before them.,只有二十多岁的孩子们，二十多岁的青年人， 刚毕业，正是在青春选择的时期，OK呀，他有多多的选择。
"We, on the other hand, have fewer opportunities, so all we can do is to mind each step on the path we have chosen.",我们却没有了，没有太多的机会了，所以我们要认认真真走好脚下这条路。
This is the inspiration I got from the children.,这是孩子们的无意当中给的我的一个启发。
You may also believe that they can do better with fewer choices.,而且你也相信当他们没有选择的时候，他们能做得非常好。
"On the contrary, they are offered too many choices, and any choice that is not made or fulfilled by themselves is not a good one at all.",可是问题是他们在生活当中往往意味着选择太多，所以任何一个选择，只要不是孩子自己做出来的，不是孩子自己去实践的，都不会是好的选择。
"The third story I’d like to share is that during the walk, a teenager of about thirteen told us that after the journey he realized that pain makes his existence more real.",第三个事，我们那次分享的时候，台上有一个十三四岁的孩子说了一句话，他说：“走完戈壁之后我才发现，原来疼痛能使我更加真实的知道我的存在。”
It’s astonishing that such a young child can draw such a philosophical conclusion.,一个孩子他能有这样一个非常哲学性的总结，非常超乎我们的意外。
"He didn’t receive any professional training, so how could he speak such profound words?",因为他的大脑，他的思维并没有经过这样的哲学化的训练，他怎么能说出这样哲学化的话呢？
"When I was young, I always thought that children are a gift from Heaven, and that god will often deliver messages to us through our children.",小时候我经常觉得孩子是上帝送的一个礼物，他经常会把上帝带给你的一些神秘的信息，透过他的嘴传递给你。
"Nowadays, we are rethinking to define what “thinking” is.",今天我们是rethinking，什么是思想呢。
Does everyone recognize this character?,大家认识这个字吗？
"Yes, it reads “si”, and it’s the earliest written form that we can find.",“思”，没错，我们现在能查到的最早的“思”字儿的写法 。
"Look at the upper part, does it look like a head?",上面是一个，像不像一个头？
"Actually, this part reads “xin”, referring to the fontanel, or the soft, boneless area of a baby’s skull.",这个其实那个“囟”，就是小孩头脑顶上那个没有封的那个骨头，叫囟门，“囟”字。
What’s the lower part?,底下是个什么呀？
"“Xin”, known as heart today.",“心”，就是我们今天很熟悉的心。
Our ancestors believed that thinking was the product of the head and the heart.,所以古人就认为思想这件事，思考这件事，是大脑加心灵的共同的工作。
"The head alone cannot think, and we can see in Chinese writing that any character denoting thought has a “heart” component.",思考的事不是光靠大脑能完成的，你看任何一个跟“思”有关系的“思想”，“想”字也是带着心。
"Thinking is not independent of the heart; and without the heart, thinking is not genuine.",如果没有心，思考是不成立的，不是真正整体的思考。
"Well, imagine how can a student score highly in a math contest?",反过头来我们再看一看我们今天的奥数？
Must he use his heart or his head?,用的上面部分还是下面部分？
The results of the College Entrance Exam were released lately.,高考分数刚发。
Is it a test of the head or the heart?,高考的分数考的是上面这部分还是下面这部分？
What is education like in our schools?,学校课堂教育？
Is it about the head or the heart?,教的是上面那部分还是下面这部分？
"If you hope that your child can be a true grown-up in the future, then travel with him, face challenges with him, and solve problems with him.",所以如果我们希望我们的孩子未来成一个完整的人，多和他一起出去走一走，多和他一起去面对挑战，多和他一起去解决困难。
Only then can you truly know your child and help him to be a fully developed person.,你才会真正地跟孩子打破你心中的隔阂，真正让他成为一个完整的人。
"To be honest, I had a sweet encounter today.",说到最后呢，其实我今天还有一个甜蜜的偶遇。
"My daughter went traveling with her classmates after graduating from high school, and I don’t know where they went until today when I arrived at Shanghai and discovered that she is here, too.",因为恰好今天，我女儿是高中毕业以后的毕业旅行，和同学们一起毕业旅行，正好今天到上海，我之前都不知道，到这我才知道她们正好今天到上海。
"So I invited my daughter, right there, Fei.",所以我让我女儿也过来了，在那儿，小菲。
"In fact, I brought a gift for her.",我其实给她今天也特别带了一个小礼物。
It’s a video we recorded three years ago when we went traveling in the Gobi Desert.,就是我们三年前一起走戈壁的时候，我们做的那个片子。
Now I’d like to watch it with you.,我想和大家一起看一下这个片子，回顾下这个片子。
"By playing this video, I want to tell my daughter that this trip is not truly a graduation trip, as you will have far more meaningful trips in the future while expanding your horizons.",我也想透过这片子呢，对我女儿讲，其实今天的毕业旅行，还并不是真正的毕业旅行，我们真正面对人生的毕业旅行，在未来的不久将真正的走出去。
"We are not likely to have an encounter like this, however, when you’re in the wider world.",也许在那之后，我们很少会有机会在一个偌大的世界里，像今天一样甜蜜的偶遇了。
"But no matter what chance we have, no matter how far you go, you will always receive love and blessings from your mother and me, just as the song in this video will accompany you forever.",但是不管有没有这样的机会，不管将来你的毕业旅行会走得多远，爸爸妈妈的爱，爸爸妈妈的祝福，都会像这个片子的那支歌一样永远的伴随着你。
Thank you all!,谢谢大家!
"Hello, there!",呃大家好！
I would like to talk about literature today.,今天呢我想跟大家谈谈文学。
Let’s start with a novel Doctor Zhivago.,呃先从这个《日瓦戈医生》这部小说开始谈起啊。
Those who have seen its film adaptation may still recall the scene of Dr. Zhivago’s death.,呃很多人都看过同名的电影，可能记得那个日瓦戈医生之死的那幕场景。
It was on a trolley bus.,就是日瓦戈在那个电车上。
"Zhivago caught sight of a lady on the street, who looked very much like his lover Lara.",突然呃看到那个街边有一个女士，好像很像他的情人拉拉。
"He thus rushed off the bus, only to fall to the ground, dead.",于是他赶忙想要呃挤到车下去，结果在路上就倒地身亡了。
The depiction of this scene in the novel is different from that in the movie.,那么在小说的处理当中呢，是跟电影是不同的。
Compare the two different media-based versions and we can see an ingenious design made by the author Pasternak.,我们可以比较一下这两个不同体裁的版本，从而看到这个小说作者帕斯捷尔纳克，当中的一个颇为巧妙的匠心。
"In the novel, Dr. Zhivago’s death was like this.",呃在小说《日瓦戈医生》当中呢，日瓦戈之死是这样处理的。
"It also happened on a trolley bus, which stopped and went due to some technical problems.",当时也是在一个电车上，那电车出了故障时走时停。
"In the carriage, Zhivago felt suffocated and had a chest pain. He tried to rush off the bus.",然后日瓦戈觉得那个车厢里面非常闷，他心脏也觉得不舒服想要挤下去。
"Then he had a sudden heart attack and fell to the ground, dead.",结果当他挤到这个路边的时候呢，心脏病发作就倒地身亡了。
There was indeed a lady in Pasternak’s depiction.,这时候呢帕斯捷尔纳克确实为他安排了一位女士。
"It’s just that she’s not Lara, but a stranger.",不过不是他的情人拉拉，而是位陌生的女士。
The author immediately turned to a lengthy portrayal of this unknown lady.,然后这个时候呢，作者就笔锋一转开始用很大的篇幅去描写这位女士。
This may seem very weird for ordinary readers.,这个如果我们一般的阅读经验会觉得非常奇怪。
"After all, the protagonist was about to die, which was supposed to be shocking.",因为这么一个小说的主人公他马上就要死亡了，本该是一个轰轰烈烈的场景。
How come did the author take an abrupt turn?,为什么作者突然把这个笔调荡开呢？
"In his lengthly and thorough depiction, she was a Swiss lady in lilac; due to various coincidences, she was trapped in Russia, where she experienced twists and turns.",而且他花了大量的篇幅描写这位陌生的女士，这个女士呢是一个穿紫衣服的瑞士籍的女士，然后因为各种偶然巧合呢，她被留在俄罗斯不能走了，然后历经了波折一生就被荒废过去了。
"Right then, she was still struggling for her destiny.",此刻呢她正在为自己的命运奔走等等等等。
"This sudden change to the depiction of a stranger seems very odd, creating a cold and nonchalant vibe to the death scene.",然后会觉得非常奇怪，因为当这个陌生人插进来的时候，这个死亡的场景突然变的非常冷淡，并且有了一种疏离的感觉。
That brings to my question for you today.,所以我想就是大家可以先想一想。
Why did Pasternak design Dr. Zhivago’s death that way?,为什么帕斯捷尔纳克要这样处理日瓦戈医生的死亡？
"Also, I would like to share with you my view on this novel.",嗯，然后呢我就是大致讲一下我对于日瓦戈医生这个小说的一些看法啊。
"For a long time, this novel was used as a weapon in the Cold War and both its lovers and haters considered it a political novel.",很长的时间它一直被当做是冷战的武器，就是他的支持者、反对者，都说它是一本政治小说。
"Decades later, when we review it once again from a literary and aesthetic perspective, we realize that it was not a weapon in the Cold War.",其实隔了这么长的时间，我们再回过来，从文本的角度、从审美的角度来看，就会发现到它并不是这么一个冷战的武器。
Even Khrushchev recalled in his memoir years later that he hadn’t read Doctor Zhivago.,甚至赫鲁晓夫在很多年以后，在回忆录当中也说，他当时根本没有就读过日瓦戈医生。
"Had he done so, he wouldn’t have launched a campaign against Pasternak.",如果他读过的话，他绝对不会在当时发动对帕斯捷尔纳克的批判。
"I personally don’t consider Doctor Zhivago a political novel nor a historical one, for Pasternak remained focused on the Mr. Nobody, namely, Zhivago throughout the novel.",嗯，那么在我看来呢，日瓦戈医生既不是政治小说，它也不是历史小说，因为帕斯捷尔纳克他自始至终的笔触都集中在日瓦戈医生这个小人物身上。
"Despite the relentless advancement of time, readers have stayed in his inner world and his life.",虽然这个历史在翻滚，在汹涌地往前，但是我们始终停留在他的精神世界和个人的一个生平上。
"We appreciate his gentleness deep inside, his longing for love and his passion for beauty and poetry.",我们会看到他内心保存着温柔，保存着对爱的向往，对美和对诗歌艺术的这样一种激情当中。
"All such things as revolution, famine, internal war and migration were reduced to a background of this Mr. Nobody’s monologue.",嗯所有的那些革命啊、饥荒啊、内战啊、迁徙啊，都变成了他一个小人物的这样的一个个人的内心的一个独白的一个背景身。
"In a sense, the novel is not an epic of a particular historical period, but a story about an individual.",所以这从某种意义上来说，他不是一个时代的历史，书写的是一个个人的历史。
Our entire reading follows the life track of Dr. Zhivago.,我们整个阅读过程当中始终地随着日瓦戈医生这个人走。
"Yet, at the moment of Zhivago’s death, Pasternak took an abrupt break and forcibly inserted a stranger’s perspective.",但是当他死亡的一刻，帕斯捷尔纳克突然把这个镜头拉远，把我们从日瓦戈医生的世界抽离出来，强行地插入了这么一个陌生人的视角，这么一个他者的视角。
"Through the view of that Swiss lady in lilac, we could bring Dr. Zhivago back to that cold world.",然后我们透过那个紫衣服的瑞士籍女士的眼睛，我们就把日瓦戈医生还原到这个冰冷的世界上面。
He seemed no more than a stranger falling to the roadside.,看来他不过是这个路边倒地而亡的一个陌生人。
"Then coming into our view were that stop-and-go trolley bus, a crowded street, Moscow and even the entire Russia.",呃然后看到了那个抛锚的电车，看到了那条来往人群非常多的街道，看到了莫斯科乃至整个俄罗斯。
"As we kept zooming out, Dr. Zivago became an increasingly dim dot.",然后这这个镜头越拉越远，日瓦戈医生也变成一个越来越渺小的点。
This switch of perspective is actually quite interesting.,这个这个镜头的切换，这个视角的切换，其实非常有意思。
"After all, as we read on, we became more and more related to Zhivago.",因为在我们看来，我们的因为我们的这个随着整个的阅读，我们对日瓦戈非常有感情。
"When we “witnessed” the scene through the view of the Swiss lady in lilac, we suddenly realized he couldn’t be more common in the grand picture of history.",但是当我们透过突然透过这个呃紫衣的瑞士籍女士的眼睛的时候，发现他不过是一个在历史的洪流当中普通的再普通，渺小的再渺小的这样一个普通人。
"When walking through the crowd, the Swiss lady gave him a passing glance and said to herself, “I don’t know him, nor do I care about his death.”",然后瑞士籍女士呢就走过的时候挤在人群当中看了一眼，想：噢这个人也不认识，跟我没什么关系，我何必在意他死死呃死活呢。
"She then went straight ahead, “quite unaware that she had overtaken Zhivago and survived him”, added the author.",她就继续往前走了，然后作者就写道说：她一点都不知道，她超过了日瓦戈，并且活的比他长。
Pasternak’s sympathy for this Mr. Nobody was thus revealed.,这个地方就是帕斯捷尔纳克对这么一个小人物的悲悯之心，就已经是跃然纸上了。
"When seen in a bigger picture of history, Zhivago, having weathered vicissitudes, was no different from the lady in lilac, for both were passively drawn into historical process, leaving nothing behind, not even their names.",因为在跟着日瓦戈历经了沧桑之后，会发现当他还原到历史当中的时候，他和那个紫衣女士是一样的，两个人都被历史冲刷而过，有一天留不下任何名字，甚至是任何的痕迹。
"This is my understanding of this novel, which had a disruptive impact on my established perception of novel writing.",所以这是我对日瓦戈医生这部小说的看法，这个小说也引发了我对于一些就是小说写作的上面的一些观念的一些震动。
"In the mainstream system of Chinese literature, two genres are particularly valued for being grand and magnificent.",比如说我现在很想举一个我自己个人趣味上的比较，中国主流的这个文学呃谱系里面对两类作品特别青睐，就觉得它们非常厚重，非常宏大。
One is epic-style narrative; the other is native narrative.,那一类呢就是史诗制的写作，另一类呢是地方制式的写作。
They both feature lengthy and grand narrative in hundreds of thousands of words.,这两类呢篇幅通常非常大，可能几十万字，然后呢内容非常的广博。
Those works are deemed miniature of a certain historical period or a certain region.,呃，我们会说起就是说比如说，啊这个是写了某某一段历史或者那部作品是写了某某地方。
"With such reading experience, Chinese readers are prone to identify a contemporary man of letters as a certain region or period-focused one.",呃在经过这样的阅读之后，我们有时候想起中国的当当代的某位文学大家，会觉得噢谁谁谁他是专门写某个地方的，或是谁谁谁他写某一个历史时代特别好。
"Strangely, we somehow seldom associate a writer with a particular character he or she created.",但是非常奇怪的是，我们很难把这个作家和他笔下的某一个具体的人物就是联系起来。
"I mean, the name of a writer does not remind me of a particular character in his or her work.",会觉得说哦我想起这个作家就马上想起某一个人物的形象。
Chinese writers tend to leave a vague impression that all characters they created just passively and apathetically underwent various ordeals and lived on.,你会觉得有一种含含混混不的感觉，就好像所有的人物都在这个历史漩涡当中麻木地呃打转，然后就是被动地接受各种苦难，就有这种感觉。
"Of those modern and contemporary Chinese literary works (100,000 words+), few focused on the depiction of an individual or was entitled their protagonist’s name.",就像这样的中国现当代文学中很少有几十万字的大作品，是用来描写一个人物，以一个人物命名的。
"There may be a few exceptions, such as famous works Zhang Juzheng and Li Zicheng, which came from their protagonists’ names.",偶尔有，比如说《张居正》《李自成》，那也是两部非常有名的作品。
"It’s just that the two protagonists were historical figures, i.e. Mr. Big, not Mr. Nobody.",但是他大家注意这个是大人物，这两位都是历史大人物，没有小人物。
"In Russian writers’ works, however, there is no shortage of major works focusing on Mr. Nobody.",但是俄罗斯的作品里面，我们随手举就会举到就是大作品用于描写小人物。
"Examples include Anna Karenina, Doctor Zhivago and The Brothers Karamazov.",比如说：《安娜·卡列尼娜》《日瓦戈医生》《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》。
"They exposed a huge dilemma concerning history, religion or even life order through depiction of an individual or a family.",它就是描写一个人或者一个家庭，从而反映一个巨大的一个问题，比如说反映了历史、反应了宗教问题、乃至是整个生命的秩序。
Then it occurred to me my teacher of Chinese used to say a good literary piece is supposed to represent something bigger and profounder.,那么我就想到就是我以前语文课上啊老师经常说什么是好的文学作品呢？就要以小见大。
"Under such guidance, we have been trained since little to conclude a challenge of times, historical problem or social phenomenon from a work.",然后我们从小归纳中心思想就会说，啊这部作品写了一个什么人物，从而反映了一个什么时代问题、历史问题、社会现象。
This is also a representation of the “seeing something bigger and profounder from the small” logic.,那么这个也是一个以小见大的这样个逻辑的一个变向的表述。
Has it every occurred to you what exactly the “small” and the “big” refer to in this logic?,那么在这个逻辑当中，是我们有没有想过就是什么是小什么是大呢？
"Based on my years of experience in texts’ central idea summarizing, I suppose the “big” includes history, society, era, the unprivileged majority, workers-farmers-soldiers combination, the entire humanity, etc., etc.",呃根据我多年的总结课本中心思想的经验噢，就大就一般性就包括像历史、社会、呃这个时代，然后就是比如底层人民、工农兵群众、啊广大的全人类之类之类的。
"Anyway, they all feature an abstract or collective concept.",那它共同的就是说要么是抽象概念，要么是集体概念。
What does the “small” refer to?,那么什么是小呢？
"By contrast, it must refer to something specific and single, say, a flower, a weed, a view or a person.",那相呃相对而言那一定是具体的，单个的事物，比如说一花、一草、一个景色、一个人。
"In this “seeing something bigger and profounder from the small”, the small is the means, while the big is the target.",在这里呢以小见大，小是手段，大是目的。
"That is to say, from a perspective of traditional Chinese literature, the depiction of an individual is to reflect certain historical or social problem.",就是也就是说以这样的逻辑具体表述说当我描述一个人的时候，我们传统的一个文学观念就觉得我们通过描述这个人，反映了一个历史的社会的什么问题。
This is what a good work is supposed to be like.,这是一个好作品的逻辑，就叫以小见大，在这里人是手段，呃那个大的概念是呃目的。
"This view easily leaves the impression that the depiction of an individual for individual’s sake is not justified in literature as it is shallow, small and valueless.",呃那么这样的一个观念呢，就会会导致就觉得噢关于单个人的描述在文学观念，它不能单单地成立，否则它就是浅薄的、渺小的、没有价值的。
"This view, through long-term imperceptible influence, has resulted in undue depreciation of writers such as Zhang Ailing, whose works were considered individual-focused, short-sighted and of bourgeoise taste.",所以这个观念的潜移默化呢导致长期比如说像张爱玲的这样的作家，她长期在文学史里面地位并不高，因为说起她就会说，哎呀小情小调，描写一些小人物，小资情调。
Zhang was excluded from the great writers list because she did not care much about national interest and politics.,嗯不关心民族大义也不关心政治，是个小作家。
Some may argue that Zhang Ailing’s literary status has now improved a lot.,那么我们就会想到就是说，张爱玲和现在的一个文学的呃文学的地位有很大的不同啊。
"This actually reminds me of another renowned female writer of her time, Ding Ling.",我就想到联想到另外一个比较，比如说当时也有一位非常有名的女作家叫丁玲。
"Ding belonged to the League of the Left-Wing Writers, who were critical of Zhang’s style of writing.",她当时也是左翼的一些作家都批评张爱玲嘛。
"Besides, Ding also actively embraced politics.",她也是丁玲是比较拥抱政治、投身政治呃呃这样的一个人物。
"Ding was the author of The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River, an influential novel about land reform.",她当时有一篇很有名的土改关于土改的一个小说，叫做《太阳照到桑干河上》。
"Yes, it is familiar to all.",嗯，大家都很了解。
"In fact, Zhang Ailing also tried the same topic, which, I’m afraid, is not known to many.",那但是张爱玲也写过土改，可能不是很多人都了解。
"Two of Zhang’s novels, i.e. Naked Earth and The Rice Sprout Song: a Novel of Modern China also touched upon the political issue of land reform.",张爱玲有两部小说，一个是《赤地之恋》，一个是《秧歌》，也是写了一个土改的这样一个呃政治的一个问题，政治的事件。
"Who’s better at the same political topic? Was it Ding Ling, who embraced and threw herself into politics, or Zhang Ailing, who remained nonchalant to and disengaged from it.",那么在这两个女作家啊就是拥抱政治、投身政治的丁玲女士和这个对政治处于一种疏离和冷淡的张爱玲女士同样写作同一个政治问题的这两种不同的小说之间，她们怎么样一个高下呢？
"With the elapse of time, the answer has become increasingly clear, whether it’s from an aesthetic or politically-correct perspective.",其实无论从审美还是从政治正确与否来说，我们今天隔了这么些时间，我们其实已经有很明确的判断了。
"One must wonder how come Zhang, who had little interest in politics, chose to write about land reform.",那么为什么就是说张爱玲这么一个不关心政治的人，她会去写土改呢？
"She actually had a profound understanding of and compassion for human nature, although Zhang may leave readers the impression of being tart and mean.",她其实她这个人是对人性有巨大的体察和怜悯的，我们说到张爱玲觉得她是一个刻薄尖酸的小女人，但是其实她的笔下的怜悯也是非常深刻的。
"For example, in her work Naked Earth, a landlord’s wife in the late pregnancy was stripped naked and hanged to death.",比如说她在那个《赤地之恋》里面她写一个地主婆，被人呃已经怀了孕肚子已经很大了，然后被人就是剥光了衣服吊在梁上吊死。
Zhang’s usual approach to depiction was calm and restrained.,这个时候她平时的叙述描写都是通过不动声色地叙述来表达她的观点。
"But she made an exception by asking, “how can human dignity be retained when they are treated like livestock?”",但这个时候她按捺不住就自己跳出来她说：把人当作像畜生一样对待，这个人的尊严在哪里呢？
"In her depiction, when the arrested landlord was about to be executed, he knelt down in the wind, trembling.",包括她描写就是这个地主在里面被抓起来要临刑的时候，她描写那个人就在这个乘风当中瑟瑟发抖跪在那里。
"Zhang then commented, “the tremble and the fresh pain brought by the cold wind, will disappear with his life.”",然后她说，她就感慨说：哎呀这个颤抖，这个寒冷也是新鲜的肉体的痛苦，即将随着生命的消逝而消失。
Such a sigh showed a compassion for life.,她这样的叹息是非常地充满了对生命的怜悯。
It was her profound understanding of human nature that kept her away from any grand political belief or party and enabled her to see something going wrong.,也正是因为她对于人性，对于生命的一个洞悉，使得她虽然不关心大的主义或者是谁执政和什么政党之类的，她都不关心，她意识到这时候是出了问题了。
"After all, basic human rights were not guaranteed.",因为已经所有的人都不把人当作人看了。
"Upon returning from the countryside, Zhang quickly made an excuse and left China’s mainland.",呃所以她就从农村回来以后，迅速找了个借口离开了中国大陆。
"Her rest life is known to all, for which I will skip it.",呃然后接下来的事情大家都知道了，我就按过不表了。
"Speaking of the improvement of Zhang’s literary status, Mr. Hsia Chih-tsing’s contributions cannot go unnoticed.",张爱玲的那个文学地位的改变呢，有一位学者是功不可没的，那就是夏志清先生。
"As a scholar, Hsia spoke highly of Zhang Ailing.",夏志清先生对于张爱玲说非多非常多的赞美之词啊。
"According to him, Zhang was among the most distinguished and important writers of contemporary China, the Golden Cangue is the best-ever novelette of China and The Rice Sprout Song a masterpiece in the history of Chinese fiction.",说她是中国当代最呃当今最优秀、最重要的作家，说《金锁记》是中国有史以来，最最伟大的中篇小说，说《秧歌》是中国小说史上的不朽之作等等。
"Hsia Chih-tsing re-evaluated not just Zhang Ailing, but also Zhang Tianyi, Shen Congwen and others.",夏志清其实重新评判的不止张爱玲，他还包括张天翼呀、沈从文等等。
Hsia’s supporters admire him for his rewriting of the history of modern Chinese fiction.,有夏志清的拥趸会说，哎呀夏志清先生是重写了中国的现代文学史。
"I like his book A History of Modern Chinese Fiction, which I think is an attack against the Leftist literary standard.",我也是非常喜欢中国文学现代史的，我觉得这本书是对一次左的文学标准的一种侵袭。
"Hsia had been consistent in his view of literature, calling for a return to literature itself and a return to human.",夏志清本人他对于这个如何去判断文学，他有自己非常稳定的一个价值观，那就是回到文学，回到人本身。
"Such a view may be applied to re-evaluating the two genres we mentioned just now, namely, epic-style narrative and native narrative.",呃所以用这样的价值观再来评判啊，我刚才说了有两类作品，一类是史诗性的作品，一类是地方制式的作品。
The purpose of native narrative is not to showcase local customs and practices but to unveil human relationships.,那么就是地方制式的作品也同样如此，我们喜欢说嗯一个作品描写了风土人情，其实在当中风土不是目的，人情才是目的。
"In a time, I liked such works very much and was impressed by their slow proceeding, which formed a barrier to smooth reading.",我有一段时间很喜欢读这样的大作品，我会有一个印象，我会觉得呃嗯那种地方制的作品有一个阅读的障碍，那就是进入非常缓慢。
The author gradually unfolded a story as if it was the scroll of Riverside Scene at Qingming Festival.,就是开始开篇的时候，作者会就像清明上河图一样的把这个画轴慢慢地展开。
"With more trees, pavilions, views and characters emerging, the story became more vivid.",我会看到啊这有颗树，那有个亭子，这儿有个景，然后慢慢的里面的人物动起来，故事开始产生起来。
This genre features a long and redundant beginning.,要进入的话就觉得这个开篇非常冗长。
I used to think it an inevitable defect until I read Tales of Hulan River by famous writer Xiao Hong.,我曾经以为这是不得已的，所有的这一类作品都会是有这个缺陷，直到我读到另一位很有名的作家叫萧红，萧红的她的《呼兰河传》，直到我读到这一篇为止。
This novel also falls into native narrative.,《呼兰河传》也是一个呃风土人情式的地理呃地理写作。
"She began the story at a crossroads in a little town and daringly gave a 3,000-word depiction of a mud pit there.",她开篇就讲了一个小城镇的十字街，然后她好大胆啊，她居然用三千字写了这街上的一个泥坑。
"While reading, I was totally attracted by it and felt anything but redundant.",但是我阅读的时候一点都不觉得冗长，我会觉得好抓人呐。
"When I became a novelist later, I did some research in her writing magic that made the lengthy depiction of a pit so attractive？",后来我因为也是写小说的，我会去研究说她有什么文字的魔力，吸引我去看她用那么长的篇幅，一开始就来写一个坑呢？
I discovered that she injected human feelings into her depiction.,后来我发现就是她写那个坑的时候，她是把人带进来。
"Sometimes, a heavy rain could flood the pit; while a dry season could shrink it.",就是说这个坑下啊下雨天发大水，呃干旱天它就变小。
Horses frequently fell into it.,然后这个坑里面经常马掉进去了。
Pigs got drowned there.,猪淹死了。
And water overflowing it ruined a wall nearby and destroyed houses.,然后一会儿就冲的旁边的墙坏了呀，房子倒了呀。
"Revolving around the mud pit, the surrounding residents’ life and relationships were thus presented.",然后这个来往的人以及周边的居民，他们的人情世故、冷暖百态，全部都是围绕着这个坑开始动起来。
"Yes, her writing magic lies in the target’s interaction with people.",噢你会发现，原来她的秘密在这里。
"Without such an interaction, the depiction of a view or local landscape would reduce to static piling of dull words.",就是说当我们在描写一个景，一一个地方的风情的时候，如果不跟人发生关系的话，它只是一堆死了的好词好句静态地放在那里。
"Once related to human nature and feelings, the depiction becomes vivid and charming.",但一旦它跟人的内心跟人性发生关系的时候，它就动起来了，就非常的有魅力。
No wonder Mr. Hsia Chih-tsing also spoke highly of Xiao Hong.,所以说那个夏志清先生对萧红的评价也非常高。
"He said that Xiao was a great writer and that she was even more gifted than Mao Dun, although Mao wrote a preface to her Tales of Hulan River.",他说：萧红真是伟大呀！茅盾虽然给《呼兰河传》作了序，但茅盾，怎么能写出这么好的作品呢？
That’s his comment.,所以这是他的一个评价。
"In short, speaking of returning to literature, we must be well aware that literature is essentially about science of man.",所以简而言之呢，就是当我们要回归的时候，我们就要一清晰地意识到一个观念就是，文学就是人学。
I know it sounds corny.,这个话我们其实听了很多，觉得老耳朵都要起老茧了。
But we never take it seriously enough and seldom think about its exact meaning.,但我们很长时候不会去辨析说。
Does it refer to an individual or a collective term?,这个人是什么？
We or I?,这个人是单个的人，还是复数的人？
A single person or a group?,是我们还是我，是一个个的还是一群一群的？
"At the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art of 1942, Mao Zedong gave his famous speeches, arguing that art and literature should serve workers, farmers and soldiers and should also serve politics.",呃1942年的时候呢，就是有那个很著名的延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，当时这个讲话的一个精神就是，呃文艺要为工农兵服务、文艺要为政治服务。
"Mao’s speeches triggered numerous reflections, analyses and disputes later on.",虽然对这个讲话啊后来有很多的反思、分析和争论哦。
"In fact, their core idea has had a profound impact on Chinese readers.",但是这个精神其实很长时间的影响了我们的阅读观念。
"We have been told literature should serve the grass-roots group, namely, workers, farmers and soldiers, and should reflect major historical and social issues.",我们会觉得啊呃文学是要为底层人民写作，底层人民其实就是一个工农兵的一个变体的表述，或者说呃文学要反映历史、要反映社会、要反映大问题。
This is another way of saying literature should serve politics.,这也就是一个呃就是文学要为政治服务的一个变体的表述。
Individuals must be integrated into a group and be associated with a grand and abstract concept.,因为在这里面个人必须和集体绑在一块儿，个人必须和抽象的宏大的概念绑在一块儿。
"Otherwise, literature is considered meaningless.",否则的话就好像一个文学就没有意义。
Maybe we can examine this concept the other way round.,嗯在这里的话呢，我又觉得我们有没有可能哦，呃把这个文学的观念反过来想一想。
"History is a temporal concept, while geography is a spatial one.",历史它是一个时间的概念，地理它是一个空间的概念。
And man is precisely at the intersection of time and space.,时间和轰空间它们作为一个交交叉的十字区，它们只有一个交叉点，那就是人。
"Should humans go extinct, history and geography would lose their meaning.",当人不存在的时候，历史和地理都是没有意义的。
Neither mountains nor rivers have consciousness.,因为人不存在的话，你说这个山这个水它有意义么？
Their significance is all given by man.,它不知道自己的存在。
"Without humans, time would be an empty concept and elapses meaninglessly.",然后如果没有人的话，时间只是空空地向前，它也不发生任何的意义。
It is human existence that makes history and geography meaningful.,所以只有人的存在，才有历史的意义，才有地理的意义。
"By placing man at the most important position, we come up with a reversed logic of literature.",所以要把人放在这个呃最重要的位置的时候，我们会发的发现有一个反向的这样一个文学的逻辑。
"I mean the purpose of writing is not to reflect history or society, but to highlight the importance of an individual.",那不是说人要去反映历史、反映社会，而是说单个的人他是最重要的。
"Individuals are part of social life, which is part of an era, which is part of history.",因为单个的人构成生活，一个一个人的生活构成时代；一个一个的时代构成历史。
"Thus, the ultimate target is man, not history.",历史目不是目的人才是目的。
This is my rough view on literature.,呃所以说这个大致的就是我的一个文学的观念。
"One of my favorite writers is Joseph Brodsky, an exiled Russian writer who hadn’t received much education.",我很喜欢的一个俄罗斯作家叫布罗茨基，他是长期流亡出去的啊，所以他而且他也没有读过很多书。
"Later, he shaped his views of literature, world outlook and values through self-study.",所以他的很多后面的文学的观念、世界观、价值观，都是通过自己的学习来重建的。
He used to say his pursuit of writing could be simply summarized as “spirit of individualism.”,我喜欢他的一句话，他说：我的写作归纳起来不过就是我追求的是，个人主义精神。
I really like it.,啊这是我所喜欢的。
Thank you all!,呃谢谢大家！
I do not have a microphone with me.,好像我上来没带话筒啊。
Does this make me different from other speakers?,是是不是因为我跟其他人不一样?
"But I have brought a smartphone, and I believe all of you have one in your pocket.",我拿了一个手机，呃我相信我们今天在座的诸位，你们应该都带了手机。
"As the cellist has just pointed out, technology can sometimes be unreliable.",呃刚刚呢其实听这个大提琴演奏家说到的，这个科技有的时候不靠谱。
"On the contrary, I  think I can count on our smartphones as well as WeChat.",但是我觉得呢，对于我来说，手机挺靠谱，微信也挺靠谱。
Thank you!,谢谢大家！
"Well, I am very delighted to be invited to speak on the stage of  TnDao.",那么，今天非常高兴受邀请来到这个“听道”论坛。

"Because after all, we are all particles that make up this environment.",因为大大的环境不就是由我们一个个小小的具体的个体所构成的吗。
"I think maybe we could all become that butterfly over the amazon river, which without a slight shake of wings, could trigger bigger change.",我想，你我都可以做亚马逊河流上的那一只蝴蝶，我们轻轻地扇动翅膀，一定有意想不到的事情发生。

"We can enter “unit.baidu.com” in the browser's address bar to reach the home page of the UNIT platform, then click ""Use"" to open the actual background management page.",然后呃，大家进入那个UNIT平台呢，我们可以在浏览器中首先输入unit.baidu.com进入UNIT平台的首页，额然后从首页点击“使用”，可以进入UNIT平台的那个后台的这种真正的管理页面。
"On the UNIT platform, the range of tasks that a robot can handle is defined as a scenario.",额在UNIT平台中我们定义额一个机器人它能够处理的事务范围称为场景。
"Generally speaking, one scenario corresponds to a robot that handles a specific task.",那个一个场景一般呢对应的是一个那个处理特定任务的机器人。
"Therefore, I will use ""robot"" instead of ""scenario"" later to make it easier to understand.","所以呃为了大家理解方便呢,后面儿我都用机器人来代替场景来说。"
"Next, let's take a practical case as an example to see how to build a robot on our UNIT platform to handle practical tasks.",呃下面我们将以一个实际的例子来看，怎么在我们UNIT平台中来创建一个嗯能够处理实际任务的机器人。
"Okay, the first step,  click ""New Scenario"" and name the robot.",好，呃这是第一步吧，点“新建场景”之后可以给这个机器人起个名字。
"For example, we now name a robot as Horoscope Assistant, which helps people check their horoscopes.",比如呃，我们现在起一个叫星星座运势小助手这样的一个机器人，就是能够帮助大家去查星座运势。
"Then click ""confirm"", and a null robot is created.",然后这个点“确认”，然后这样一个空的机器人建设好了。
We can see a new row is added.,我们看新加了一层。
It's the discription of this robot.,就是这个机器人的描述。
And it has some fields that discribing the current state of the robot.,"然后它有一些字段,会表明现在这个机器人现在的状态。"
Then click view to enter the configuration page of the robot.,呃然后点击查看，我们可以进入这个机器人的这种配置页面。
Robot configuration consists of three parts on the UNIT platform.,呃在UNIT平台中呢，机器人的配置一共分成三部分。
The first is to define what the robot can do.,额第一部分就是我们要定义这个机器人它能做什么事情。
The second part is to define what knowledge should be taught to the robot so that it could understand human instructions.,第二部分呢，是我要定义说我要教给机器人哪些知识，让它能够听懂人类的指令。
"The third part, robot to learn, digest and absorb the knowledge.",第三部分呢，是把这些知识让机器人去学会、消化、吸收。
And I can verify online what capacities the robot has acquired and whether it has learned what we taught it as we expected.,同时我去可以在线验证这个机器人它学到了哪些能力，是不是真的如我们说想象的它学会了我们教它的东西。
Each robot on the UNIT platform is made up of a number of units.,呃在UNIT平台中，每个机器人是由一个个的单元构成的。
"Well, as Ke-san just said, it mainly consists of two parts. ",嗯如刚才那个珂桑说的，就是主要两两个部分。
"One deals with dialogues, and the other deals with questions and answers.",一部分是处理对话儿的，另一部分处理问答的。
"Because it's a simple scenario,horoscopes,I mean, so we just need to create one dialog unit.",因为我们这个场景比较简单，是查那个星座运势，所以我们只要建一个对话单元就可以了。
Of course you can assemble a variety of units to build a particularly complex robot.,啊当然如果你的机器人特别复杂，你可以由各种单元去联合组装，OK。
"A dialogue, by definition, involves at least one who asks and one who replies.",额对话这儿顾名思义，额有一问一答，对吧？
"When we define what the robot can do, obviously we need to consider things.",额我们现在定义机器人能做什么事情。
"One is what a user would probably ask for, and the other is under what circumstances the robot would reply.",显然是要做两部分，一部分是我定义用户他可能问什么样的东西，另一部分就是我机器人在什么情况下去做回答。
"For the user request part, did you notice the two concepts mentioned before?",额用户问的部分，额刚才那个有两有两个概念，不知道大家注意没有？
"One is ""Intention"", and the other is ""slot"".",一个是意图，一个是词槽。
"""Intention"" refers to a task or a range of tasks that the robot is intended to do.",这里我再引申说一下。所谓意图就是，你这个机器人它想做一个主要的这个事情，主要的范围是什么事情。
"""Slot"" refers to conditions required by the task.",第二个是词槽，是说你做这件事情需要哪些条件。
"As for Horoscope Widget, obviously it is to offer horoscopes information.",额对于星座运势查询来说，显然是说就是要做星座查询这个事情。
"We can simply call it LUCK-SEARCH,and give it an alias ""fortune teller"".",我可以起一个简单的名字吧，叫LUCK-SEARCH，然后额可以起一个别名叫做运势查询。
"In this way, the range of tasks has been clearly defined.",这样我这个它住的这个主要这个范畴就已经定义清楚了。
"Then，the conditions.   Before we give out horoscopes,  we need to know your star sign and what day's horoscope you want to read.",呃第二个是它的这个条件，嗯我们在查查出星座运势之前，是一般时候会说，你提供你的星座是什么，以及你要再查哪天的运势，对吧？
"so we need two conditions, one is a star sign and the other is a date.",那需要两个条件，一个是他的星座名称，另外一个条件是他的这种额要查询的日期。
"On the UNIT platform, we realize this by creating slots.",哦在UNIT平台中，我们是通过这种建词槽儿的方式来做的。
"For example,  we are creating a condition like 'star signs', we can name it with this English word.",额第一个，比如说我们现在想建一个星座名称这样的条件，额可以起一个名字吧，我们现在用这个英文来代表它名字。
"Then, clarification, which means when a user does not clearly state his star sign, you can ask an extra question: what is your star sign?",然后澄清话术，就是当那个额用户他没有描述清楚他是什么星座的时候，你可以加一句反问的话，比如说您要额查询的星座是哪个？
"And then click ""Next"".",然后下一步。
We know that star signs are enumerable.,呃我们知道星座一般额是可以枚举的。
There are 12 star signs.,我们知道星座大概就12个星座。
"Therefore, we can upload a user dictionary in advance.",可以事先传一个额用户的词典传上去。
"I won't show you the dictionary, which may includes 12 word lists.",呃这里面呃我就不展不展示词典内容，其实就是12呃大概12个词表吧。
"and then click ""Next"".",然后下一步。
"In this way, very simply, a slot of star signs is built.",这样这个星座运势非常简单的这个额关于这个星座名称的这个词槽就已经建立清楚了。
The second slot is for dates.,第二个是说用户让我们说一些日期。
But obviously dates are not as enumerable as star signs.,但日期这些东西显然跟星座名称不一样，它不可枚举。
"If you follow the approach of our previous NLU tasks, you need to enumerate all dates, which is obviously impossible.",额如果按照我们之前对这个自然语言任务理解来说，你你要如果要把时间枚举了，这个是显然不太可能的。
"But for the convenience of users, UNIT platform allows one to directly reuse the built-in capabilities of our system.",但是UNIT平台为了方便用户，我们把这个能力额额相当于让用户直接复用我们系统内置的能力。
"So in the saame way we create a condition called ""user_date"".",那同样儿我们起个名称叫做“user_date”这样一个条件。
"And the question would be ""what day are you interested in?""",然后问的还是“您要查询的日期是哪天？”，OK。
"As we see, UNIT has many built-in slots, such as movie names, person names, institution names.",啊我们看一下，额UNIT平台内置的许多这种内置的这种词槽的识别，包括这种影视名、人名、那个机构名儿这些，
Users only need to check the box instead of uploading their own slots.,额不需要用户传任何词槽，只需要简单勾选就可以。
"For example, for Horoscope Assistant, I only need to select the built-in sys_time，then click ""Next"" and ""Comfirm"".","比如现在我要做星座运势查询，只要选一下我们系统提供的一个sys_time，就是用户额这个时间,再点下一步,确定。"
In this way I have finished defining what users might ask.,这样我就把用户想能问的这个部分已经定义完了。
Our demonstration now might be a little too long.,我们再看看到如额因为现在演示可能那个说得比较多，
In practice it takes about only one minute to define what users might ask.,实际上如果你真的一操作处理，大概就一分钟左右就可以把这个用户问的部分定义清楚。
"Then the second part is situational response, that is, how the robot responds to a request.",然后第二部分就是场景回应，就是我们机器人怎么回答。
"Now let’s enter a simple sentence, ""OK,I'll check for you.""",现在我们可以先写简单写一句话吧，“好的，为您查询。”
"We know that when we are actually doing an application, we need to add the resource retrival part in addition to the language understanding part.",嗯，我们知道可能真正去做一个应用的时候，除了这个语言理解，我们还要加加一个这个资源查询的部分。
"For example, when checking horoscopes, obviously you are curious about the horoscope for a certain star sign on a certain day.",我们比如说做星座查询的时候，你显然需要需要查某一天某一个星座它的这个嗯你的这个运势是怎么样的。
So before offering the service we have to collect all resources needed for the two conditions.,这个时候，那显然去做查询之前，你必须得是把两个条件去收集清楚。
"And if these two slots are indispensable, you have some way to set them on UNIT.",然后额对于UNIT平台来说，如果额这两个词槽是你在查询中是必需的话，你可以设定一些条件去做。
"Here we provide a simple solution which can generate the conditions automatically with one click on ""smart generation"" instead of adding them one by one.",额这里边儿我们提供一个简单的操作，就不需要你去这挨个添加，可以点击智能生成。
"The two auto-generated conditions indicate that only when a user has clearly stated the date and the star sign, the robot starts checking horoscopes",额大家那个自动生成两个条件，这个条件意思就是说，只有当用户把他的日期说清楚，把他的星座说清楚之后，机器人拿回去做这种查询；
Otherwise，it responds by asking for clarification. ,如果没说清楚的话，进一步做反问，就是刚才做那种澄清话术要做的事情。
"Then click ""Save"".",然后点击保存。
"In this way, what the robot can do is defined.",这样我这个机器人都能做的事情那部分已经定义清楚了。
"To sum it up, we have defined what a user might ask, and the conditions under which the robot responds.",可以再整体看一下，就是说额我们定义了用户他可能会怎么问，以及我机器人在什么条件下做回答。
"This is the first part, teaching the robot what to do.",这是第一部分，教会这个机器人能做什么事情。
"Secondly, I need to prepare some knowledge for the robot, which it learns in a particular way to understand what I am asking him to do.",第二部分是我将需要准备一些知识来去教机器人，说呃你去按照这种模式去学习，就可以去听懂我这句话，我这句话到底要做什么事情。
"In the interest of time,I'll upload a word list,uh,a sample prepared before.",额时间关系，我还是传把那个之前我们系系统里面做好的一个词表传额样本表传上来。
"OK,let's look at an example.",OK，好我们看一个例子吧。
What does the robot need learn?,就是就机器人儿学什么东西呢？
"To put it simple, horoscope is what we need to teach the robot when the user says “I want to check my horoscope"".",简单来讲，用户说了一句话，他说“要查星座运势”，那么他星座运势我们需要教机器人什么事情呢？
I need to tell the robot that the user's intention is to get his horoscope and no condition is stated.,我要教机器人一件事情就是告诉机器人说，用户现在说的意图是要查“他的运势”，而他是没带条件的。
We just need to save this after the annotation.,只要简单把这个保存下来，标一下就可以了。
Or the user might make it clear he want to check Aries horoscope.,额第二个就是他用户可能说他可能把他的星座说清楚查白羊座运势。
Obviously what he intends is still to get horoscopes and one condition is Aries. ,那显然他要做这个事情还是查运势，而他的这个条件就白羊座，把这个东西标出来就可以了。
"Similarly, if he intends to check today's horoscope, we just need to label ""today"" as a date condition.",啊诸如此类吧，比如他查今天的话，就把今天做为一个额日期的条件把它标注出来。
"If the user gives a complete sentence, ""I want to check tomorrow's Taurus horoscope"", then we just need to tell the robot that the user's intention is to get horoscopes and his two condition are Taurus, the star sigh, and tomorrow, the date.",额这个是比较完整的话，可能用户直接说“我要查金牛座明天的运势”，我们只要告诉机器人说，额这个用户的意图是查运势，而他的两个条件，一个是金牛座，星座；另外一个是他的日期是明天就可以了。
I annotated about ten samples to teach the robot how to respond accordingly when users say any of these ten sentences.,呃我一共做了大概十标了十个呃十条样本来教用户教机器人说，呃当用户说这十句话的时候你要做这个处理。
"I am using the ten samples to illustrate what our UNIT platform is capable of, that is, the robot can learn far more than the ten sentences after giving them the ten samples.",然后我会以这十条样本儿来示例说我们今我们现在UNIT平台重要的能力，就是说机器人听了这十句话之后，其实它是可以学会更多的东西，呃不止这远远不止这十句话。
"When we have defined what the robot need to do, in Unit Configuration, and have prepared knowledge in Data Center, the only thing left is to teach these knowledge to the robot.",OK，当我们定义了机器人做什么事情，在单元配置中定义了机器人做什么事情，以及我在数据中心准备好机器人可以学哪些知识，那我们只剩一件事情，就是把这些知识教给机器人。
"On UNIT platform we add a button ""Train and Validate"".",在UNIT平台中，额我们在训练编程中加了一个按钮叫做训练并生效模型。
"Select the sample that was uploaded just now, and click ""Train"".",把刚才那个上传的这个样本选中之后，呃点击训练。
Then the robot starts the learning process. ,正好机器人开始学习去吸收这个呃过程。
"We are running out of time, so I'll show you the exact Horoscope Assistant we've done before.",因为时间关系，额我可以把之前我们完全一模一样做做成的一个东西给大家做个演示。
Let’s take a look at this.,我们可以看一下这个之前做的这个。
Its configuration is exactly the same.,它的这个配置部分其实完全一模一样儿。
The user request part and the robot response part are the same.,没有任何区别，就是它的用户问和它的这个机器人回答我们都是一样儿的。
"And in its data center, the same ten semple is used.",以及它的数据中心、它使用的样本儿也是只是这十句话。
It has been successfully trained. ,好，额这是已经训练成功的。
We will skip the machine training process.,我们就把机器训练过程省略吧。
Now we can test what the robot have learned through these ten samples.,这时候我们可以试一下，这个机器人现在它通过这十句话学到什么东西呢？
We can make a comparison. ,我们可以对比一下，
What the robot has already learned is displayed on the right side.,右边是它真正机器人学的话。
We can add an example to the left.,额左边儿，我们可以加额加一个加加一个例子吧。
"For example, I say ""get horoscopes"", which is obviously not from the ten samples.",额比如现在我想问“查运势”，那这句话显然是我在这十句话中是没并没有的。
But the robot has actually learned it，hasn't he?,但是机器人其实已经把这个东西学会了，对吧？
"The robot responds by asking ""what day do you mean?""",机器人反问人一句去说你这日期是哪天？
"OK, and I say ""Next Saturday"".",OK，比如我现在说了是呃下周六。
"OK,we can see that the robot has not only known the intention, but also recognized next Saturday as the date.",OK，它把我们可以看到它把这个机器人除了知道了意图之外，又把它的这个日期识别出来，知道下周六。
"And it asks ""what is your star sign?""",然后反问说，你要查的星座是哪个？
"Well, we add a reply, ""Aries"".",好，我们再加一个白羊座吧。
"OK, in this way the slots are filled and an exact search is done, or in our terms, fullfilled.",OK，这样就完成了一个呃它的这种词槽的搜集呢，完成一个确定的这种查询，我们叫做满足，就做完了。
This is an example of a multi-turn dialogue.,呃可以，这是一个多轮的例子。
Let's look at an example of a single-turn dialogue to see how the robot would respond when we clearly state all necessary conditions in a single turn.,我们再举一个单轮的例子，就是说我们单轮把所有的条件说清楚时候机器人会怎么回答。
"Everyone can see these ten sentences clearly, right?",额大家应该可以看清这十句话，对吧？
Get horoscopes.,查星座运势。
Get Aries horoscope.,查白羊座运势。
Get today's horoscope.,查今天运势。
"For example, now the user says, ""Tell me next Sunday's Scorpio horoscope.""",额假设我现在用户想额说了一句说，额告诉我天蝎座天蝎座下周日的运势。
"Obviously I've never given the robot this sentence.But the robot understantds it, doesn't he?",这句话显然对右边儿，这一边儿我从来没有告诉机器人告诉我这句话是在这个，机器人听懂了，对吧。
Let's try this.,试一下。
The robot can fully understand this sentence.,机器人可以完全把这句话理解清楚。
"It knows that the user wants horocopes, his star sign is Scorpio and the date is next Sunday.",它知道这个人想查运势，而且他的星座是天蝎座，他日期是下周日。
"Let's see what the UNIT platform can do for developers for the input ""next Sunday"".",额可以再看一下我呃如果对开发者来说看一下这个下周日，就用UNIT平台可以帮你做一个什么事情呢？
"It identifies next Sunday as a specific date, which is December 3, 2017.",它把下周日明确定定义到这个具体的日期，就是2017年12月3日。
You can check it out.,大家可以去看一下。
This is also a special feature of UNIT.,这也是UNIT的这个一个功能，额特殊之处吧。
"The validation page，as we see, is where developers check how well the robot works.",嗯，额我们刚才看到这种验证的这个页面，只是说为了方为了方便这个配置者去看他这机器人效果。
"After the configuration, it provide a complete background service which can be called via API.",而实际上你配完之后，就对于我们来说它是提供了一个完整的后台服务，完全可以用API的形式调用。
"In addition, we have now opened up an access to DuerOS, our Baidu's operation system.",额除了这种API形式以外呢，我们现在已经和这个我们百度的DuerOS这个操作系统已经打通了。
"As long as you build a senario, or build a robot, on UNIT, you can submit it to DuerOS with one click.",您只要把我们这把这个在UNIT平台上配置好一个场景，配置一个机器人之后，一键式就可以把它发布到这个DuerOS。
Of course DuerOS will review your submission.,当然因为DuerOS可能要有一些审核。
Once approved it will get into the DuerOS Skills Store.,只要审核通过的话，可以进入UNIT UNIT那个DuerOS上的那个技能商店。
The Horoscope Assistant I just demonstrated has already been released in the DuerOS Skills Store.,我刚才演示这个例子就是星座运势小助手，实际上我们已经发布到那个DuerOS的技能商店上了。

"Because we have not changed, we are still just human.",也正因为它不变，所以我们还是人。
"My view is that there must exist something that is beyond the capacity of technology, something that we have been striving for from generation to generation.",而因此我想，它一定是有一个技术之外的一个东西，这个技术之外的东西，是我们孜孜追求的东西。
We all know that in today's world knowledge is updating at speed.,大家知道我们现在整个世界啊，知识是变化越来越快。
"For each of us, all our knowledge must be learned.",我们每个人，从生下来的时候，都要重新开始学习。
We cannot insert an USB card into our brains to instantly know things,我们不可能通过copy U盘，在我脑袋上插一个U盘，我就有知识了。
Neither can we inherit knowledge from our parents.,我们也不可能通过遗传的方式让我获得知识。
"Despite the fact that you are a Ph.D., your baby must learn all over again as others do.",如果你是博士，你的小孩生下来也必须重新开始学习。
This is something that cannot be changed by technology.,而这就是技术之外的。
This is what I want to talk about today.,我们想讨论的。
"We all know that technology are still moving forward, but we have no clue where it might lead us.",但是大家知道，技术不断地发展，我们不知道它将走向哪里。
We all learned Newton's three laws.,我们大家都学过牛顿三大定律。
These three laws enable us to predict the existence of Uranus and Pluto.,因为牛顿三大定律我们学好以后，我们竟然可以发现，天王星，冥王星。
"Today I want to talk to you about the ""three laws"" of learning technology.",所以我想，今天想跟大家说一下，关于学习技术的三个定律。
Because these three laws may shed some insights into how to digitalize our education.,因为这三个定律也许，我们在做我们教育信息化的时候啊，会更有方向。
They may enable us to where education digitalization may lead to in the future ten or twenty years.,我们甚至可以预言十年二十年以后，我们的教育信息化会变成怎么样。
"The first law: no matter how technology develops, the essence of learning will always be self-education.",第一条定律，无论技术怎样发展，学习本质上永远是一种自我教育。
"It is impossible for us to transform knowledge into our brain through copying, clouding, or big data.",不可能，用copy的方式，不可能，用云，大数据，好像储存了很多很多的东西，好像我们就很有知识了。
"Even you have many poems inserted into your ""cloud"", you will not become a poet.",但是，不会的，如果说你的云上，存了很多很多的诗，你也不会成为诗人。
It has to be learned.,所以学习必须是通过我们去学才是可以的。
So what is learning?,那么什么是学习？
"Learning can be also called awareness, familiarity, acquisition, and mastery.",学习，我们可以把它叫做知道、熟练、学会、悟通，都是学习。
"Therefore, by its definition, this kind of learning takes time.",而这种学习的话，它都是需要时间的。
What is the second law?,那么第二个定律是什么呢？
"It is called: technology will take on a life of its own, independent of the inventor's will.",叫技术有自由意志，不以发明者的意志为转移。
Let me give you an example.,我举一个例子。
I do not know who invented keyboards.,我也不知道这个键盘啊是谁发明的。
"We use keyboards all the time, but it has a special kind of use.",我们一直用键盘的，但是键盘有一个用途。
You can make someone kneel on a keyboard.,就是用来跪的，用来跪的。
I do not know if you have had a similar experience.,我不知道大家有没有跪过这个键盘。
I once tried it.,我曾经尝试过跪一下。
The person who invented the keyboard would never imagine such a kind of use for his invention.,但是发明键盘的人，从来没有想过，竟然有人用键盘去跪的。
"Once a technology is invented, it will take on a life of its own.",它一旦生生出来以后它就有自由的意志。
"Therefore, what is the free will of technology?",那么技术的自由意志体现在什么地方呢？
"As we human being do, technology has an instinct to survive.",技术就像人一样，它想存活。
It wants to spread itself and expand its user base.,它想不断地复制自己，让更多的人去用。
It does not care how we use it.,而不在乎你是什么用的。
This is the free will of technology.,这就是技术的自由意志。
"Suppose you live in two hundred years ago, if you want to listen to music or watch a show, anytime and anywhere, the only way is to take a band or a group of dancers with you.",比如说两百年以前，如果我想随时听音乐，随时看表演，那我必须要养一支乐队，带一批舞女。
I want to see it now.,我想看。
Come and perform for me.,来，表演。
It is much simpler today.,现在不要了。
All you have to do is to swipe on your iPhone.,我只要拿出iphone我就可以看了。
"You can watch it, anytime and anywhere.",我就可以听了。
This is the free will of technology.,这个就是技术啊。
It has a tendency to get cheaper and cheaper.,它有一点，它会越来越便宜。
"Because the cheaper it is, the wider its user base will be.",因为越便宜，它可以让大家都用。
It is probably beyond the imagination of Steve Jobs that every New Year's Eve the main purpose of using iPhone is to grab red envelopes online.,但是乔布斯怎么也没想到，这个iphone我现在，在过年那个除夕的晚上，用得最多的是用来抢红包。
Sometimes I spent the whole night grabbing red envelopes.,但是，抢红包我有的时候抢了一个晚上。
"Although half of the red envelopes was worth only 0.01 yuan, they still brought me joy.",有一半以上只有一分钱，但是我还是很开心。
In the end what is the ultimate purpose of technology?,实际上的话，对我们每个人来说，我们想要的技术，是什么呢？
"The ultimate purpose is not to have an iPhone, but to enjoy the happiness it brings me.",我们想要的技术，实际上我真的不是要这个iphone，而实际上是要的这个iphone带给我的快乐。
"Likewise, the ultimate purpose is not to invent a technology that understands us, but to get to know ourselves better through the application of technology.",同样的，我也不是要这个技术来懂我，而是我想通过这个技术更懂我自己。
"However, technology has its own purpose.",但是技术完全是不一样的，技术它的自由意志就是想。
It will make all attempts to know you better so then you will become more addicted to it.,让你拥有它，使用它，因为这样所以它就千方百计地要弄懂你。
This is the free will of technology.,这就是自由意志。
The third law: benefits and risks of a technology will expand in the same proportion.,第三定律，技术的利弊空间，必定同比例拓展。
"It means that as a technology brings more benefits, it will at the same time invite more risks.",就是一样东西它技术水平提高了，那么它的不好的空间。
The benefits and risks grow in the same proportion.,也一定是同步拓展的，是一个等比例的。
We have not seen the risks because they have been deliberately controlled.,"如果说，我们现在还没有看到它不好的效果,只不过我们有意控制它。"
"However, the possibility is still there.",但是它的空间是打开了。
"Eventually, the risks will be seen.",哪一天它的不好的一定会出现。
"The greater its capacity, the riskier.",控制能力越大失控的空间就会越大。
Atomic energy is such an example.,就像原子能。
We are enjoying the benefits of atomic energy.,尽管我们现在，主要在享受原子能的好处。
"At the same time, we all want to avoid the possible risks, but the risks are still there.",但是它的不好的地方，我们大家都不想尝试，但是这个空间已经，已经打开了。
The same goes for the application of technology in teaching.,同样的，数据，信息技术用在教学当中。
It will inevitably lead to data analysis.,有一个必然的趋势，就是数据分析。
There is no doubt that data analysis will change our education in every way.,数据分析将大大地改变我们的教育，这是必然的。
Data analysis needs data from the user.,但是它要精准地分析你。
"The more data a user offers, the more accurate the analysis is.",那么你必须把你的隐私暴露出来，你暴露得越多，它才可以精准地分析你。
"However, please note that the more powerful this data analysis becomes, the greater its risks grow.",但是，请大家注意数据这个分析的能力越强，它的伤害效果会越大。
Let me give you an example.,我只要举一个例子大家就知道。
"It is common to have a medical examination, but many of us actually get freaked out over the identification of some disease.",大家都体检的，你们知道因为体检以后发现毛病吓死的人，有多少吗？
The application of technology to education has far more important impacts.,但是教育来说。
"Unlike the machines, we are capable of feeling emotions.",你们想一想，因为人是一个有情感的东西，老师是有情感的，孩子是有情感的。
Imagine a child is diagnosed as intellectually challenged.,如果大数据分析，结论告诉我，我是一个笨蛋。
The child may come to believe he is destined to become a fool.,那么我可以告诉你，我将来必定是个笨蛋。
"In this case, although the data analysis is accurate, it is against the spirit of education.",然后他来证明他的数据，分析是多么得正确。
"Therefore, in terms of its application in education, the benefits and risks of technology will have a far significant impact.",所以在这一点上，我们的整个一个技术，它的利弊空间，将会产生重大的影响。
"Under the guidance of these three laws, I want to predict how our education will evolve.",那么这三个定律，我想尝试着用这三个定律，来推导接下去我们的教育会出现什么样的变化。
"First, reaching the limit to one's learning capacity",第一个叫做学习临界。
What is the limit to one's learning capacity?,什么叫学习临界呢？
Think knowledge as water.,我们整个世界的知识啊就像水一样。
"At the beginning, it was the size of a small pond.",刚开始的这个知识，它可以放在一个小水塘里。
"Later, as the technology develops, our knowledge grows as well.",后来技术发展了，我们知识越来越多了。
The small pond turns into a lake and then into an ocean.,它可能变成一个湖泊了，再发展它就变成一个海洋了。
Now think our brain as a spoon.,但是请大家注意我们每一个人的脑袋，就像一个勺子一样。
"Even if you are a genius, your spoon and an idiot's spoon will not differ much in size.",哪怕你是个天才，你的勺子和白痴也差不了多少。
There is a limit to what you can hold with your spoon.,你不可能舀这么多东西的。
"Of course, each spoon may vary a little in size.",当然每个人的勺子大小可能不一样。
The amount of water that a spoon can hold is the limit to one's learning capacity.,这个勺子能舀的水的量，就是学习的临界。
"In today's world, knowledge has become more and more accessible, so we do not have to memorize as much as we used to do.",那么大家思考一下，对于我们现在这个状态来说，因为知识越来越方便地获取，甚至是可以很快地获取，所以我们不要记太多的东西。
Most of us may remember less than ten phone numbers now.,我们现在，可能记不了十个电话号码。
"In the past, we used to be able to remember the tunes and lyrics of a hundred songs, but now we sing Karaoke.",我们以前可以背一百首歌，现在没有没有卡拉OK，我们就不会不会唱歌了。
This change was made possible by the advancement of technology.,这个都是进步带来的。
Each of us has only one spoon.,那么，对我们每个人来说，因为有这么一个勺子。
"If we are not critical of what to learn, the spoon will be easily filled.",如果你学了太多乱七八糟的东西，它就满了。
So what is the most important thing to us?,而对每个人来说真正最重要的东西是什么？
What is the most important thing to learn?,学习最重要的东西是什么？
"In my view, there are three such capacities.",我认为是对世界的认识。
The first is our understanding of the world.,这是第一个。
The second is our way of thinking.,第二个，思维的方法。
The third is the ability to communicate and cooperate with others.,第三个，和人沟通和相处的能力。
Can these three capacities be developed directly without first acquiring the related knowledge?,那么是不是这三个能力它可以抛开知识而直接就形成呢？
That is also impossible.,那也是不可能的。
"That is to say, in the process of acquiring knowledge, we need to build these capacities at the same time.",也就是说我在通过舀这一勺知识的时候，要形成这些最基本的素养。
"This first law, which is called the limit to our learning capacity, stays constant despite the advancement of technology.",而这一点，它是超越技术之外。
It sets us to reflect.,它需要我们在座的每一个人去思考。
It is of the most importance and relevance to us.,也是我们现在最重要的最迫切的一个需要，学习临界。
"Second, graphic thinking.",第二个，叫图文思维。
"Four or five thousand years ago, when there was no written language.",在四五千年以前，还没有文字的时候。
"Back then, our way of thinking can be seen as version 1.0.",我们人的思维方法，我把它叫1.0版。
"Back then, people thought in a very concreate way, which was called figurative thinking.",人的思维方法是具体的思维方法，叫具象思维。
Their thoughts were in the form of images.,基本上是图像。
"Back then, when two person talked to each other, they would never say, "" let's we go picking peaches.”, because there was no language yet.",比如说我们两个沟通的时候啊，绝对不会说，我们现在去采桃子吧，因为没有语言。
"Imagine we are a couple living in the prehistoric time, how would we communicate?",那你想我们去采桃子，如果我和你我们是一对原始人夫妻，你怎么表达？
We would definitely communicate in a figurative way.,"一定是,形象思维。"
"Later, after the invention of written language, if I want to ask you to go picking peaches with me, I will just utter the words by mouth.",后来有了文字有了语言你们反思一下看，如果我说我们去采桃子吧，你在说这个话的时候嘴巴里出现的是语言。
"When I am speaking, what appears in my mind is the language or words rather than an image of me picking peaches.",但是你的脑子里出现的，也就是语言，也就是文字，而没有出现我采桃子吧。
"My utterance of ""picking peaches"" will still stimulate the images of peaches in your mind, but in this case, you think in an abstract way rather than a concrete way.",但是我采桃子你想到桃子的这个时候啊，不再是具体的思维，它是一个抽象的思维。
We have all become abstract thinkers after a long period of study.,我们现在平时经过长时间学习以后啊都变成抽象思维。
We are only concrete thinkers during the babyhood.,我们只有在婴儿期间有一段具象思维。
"Once we start to learn to speak and write, it is difficult for us to stay as concrete thinkers.",一旦你学会文字以后你就很难再回到具象思维。
"Now there are screens everywhere, such as our mobile phones.",但是现在因为到处存在着屏幕，比如说手机。
Communication goes beyond words.,交流已经超越了文字。
Here are some WeChat emoji on the screen.,比如说大家看到，这屏幕上出现的这几个微信上的一些图标。
"We can send an emoji to indicate that I am sleeping, I am eating, or I am angry without saying a single word.",我们经常会话不说直接发一个图标，表示我睡觉了，表示我在吃饭，表示我很愤怒。
These emoji are no longer words.,它已经不再是文字了。
They are images.,它是一种图像。
"Therefore, we humans are entering a stage of graphic thinking, a brand new stage.",所以我们人类接下去将会进入一个图文思维的一个阶段，而这个阶段是全新的。
"I believe that graphic thinking will be a key skill in the future work, which will emphasize designing capability.",我告诉大家，图文思维将是非常重要的工作，就是设计为王。
"Therefore, I suggest that all of you here get your children some design education.",所以我这里号召我们大家，让你的孩子去学设计吧。
I have sent my daughter to designing classes.,我已经让我的女儿学设计了。
"Third, the knowledge gap between a master and the general public are narrowing",第三，叫大师变矮，变矮。
"It is often heard that due to technological development, there is no master in the real sense anymore.",经常有人说，因为技术发展，这个世界没有大师了。
"Though technology has been promoted, arts and humanities have been weakened.",说技术变厚人文变薄。
I believe this view is only half correct.,这句话我认为前半句是对的。
Technology has indeed grown more powerful.,技术越来越厚。
The reason is that it has a survival instinct to spread itself.,因为技术有一个自由意志的冲动。
"However, it is wrong that humanities have been weakened.",但是，人文变薄这个话错的。
"On the contrary, humanities have been promoted as well.",它也是人文变厚。
"It may appear that masters are diminishing, but we the public now enjoy more access to knowledge at the same time .",不是因为大师没有了，而是因为我们现在每个人都非常方便地学到东西。
The knowledge gap between you and masters are narrowing.,你和人家大师差不了多少。
"One or two hundred years ago, most people had no access to knowledge.",而不像以前，一百年以前两百年以前大部分人都是没有知识的。
"Therefore, if a person has access and is smart, he will become a master.",如果有一个人拥有资源，他又拥有智慧，他就是大师。
"If I am smart, but I have no access to knowledge, then I will not have the chance to be a master.",而我拥有智慧，但是我没有资源，我不是大师。
A master is a master because the rest of the crowd know less than him.,大师是因为大家都是平地而出现的。
"Now, the good news is everyone can become a master; at least we are not so far away from becoming one.",现在我告诉大家，我也恭喜大家，大家都是大师了，至少你和大师的距离没那么远。
"Therefore, when you look around, you see fewer peaks.",所以你看的时候你就看不见高山。
This is because the knowledge gap between the masters and us has been narrowed.,所以大师没有了，是大师相对你变矮了。
"Therefore, I predict more courses that guide us how to become a master through self-regulation and by making the right choices may appear.",那么我这里要预言，这件事情将会出现一门非常重要的课程就是，怎么让你自己指导自己，把自己的路走对，让自己成为一名大师这样的课程。
"Fourth, back to the starting line.",第四个，第四个推论叫崩溃清零。
"In my childhood, I read a poem.",小的时候呢一直在读这首诗啊。
"It said, ""Lush, lush grass on the plain, once every year it sears and grows.""",离离原上草，一岁一枯荣。
"Every time I read this poem, I thought the person was so evil because he seared the grass every single year.",我每次在读这个诗的时候，我就想，这个人真坏，每年都要去点火，把那个草烧了。
What a wicked person!,真是个坏人！
"However, later when I grew up, I come to see that it is not an evil person who sets the grassland on fire.",但是长大以后我明白，真正点燃这个草原的，不是一个人。
It is God's design.,而是上帝之手。
"On the one hand, the fire kills pests and bacteria.",一方面它可以杀灭这种害虫细菌。
"On the other hand, in my view, the fire creates an opportunity for all the plants to start afresh, be they trees, shrubs or grasses.",但是我认为更重要的是，每年燃烧以后无论你是高大的乔木，还是灌木还是草，重新开始。
Technology keeps moving forward.,技术，它不断地发展。
The owner of a technology may want to control more.,而控制技术的人他是有一个控制欲的。
He hopes to control us and monitor us using his technology.,他希望他这个技术来控制你，他希望用这个技术来时刻地了解你。
"This complex is called ""the pleasure of God"".",这个乐趣啊，有一个名字叫做“上帝的愉快”。
"However, technology itself, as we have discussed, does not want to be controlled by individuals.",但是，技术本身，我们讲过了，定律当中它不需要被个别人控制。
It only has an instinct to expand its user base.,它需要更多人去用。
"However, once it is used in ways their inventors never foresee, it gets out of control and goes to its end.",但是一旦超越控制人的想象，它就失控，最终会崩溃。
It is like a burst of fire that burns everything up.,就像一阵，一阵火把什么都烧掉了。
So what kind of courses should we offer?,那么对于我们教育来说我们需要做什么？
We need courses that teach our children the courage to start afresh.,我们要做的是要有这样的一一一种课程，让我们的孩子，重新再来的勇气。
Do we have such courses?,当然这样的课程有没有？
"Yes, we do.",有的。
We have such games.,那就是游戏。
"In the game, each time we are killed, we will start from the beginning again.",游戏经常是我被人打死了，我重新又开始，又打死了又重新开始。
Our children need courses of this kind badly.,和游戏相类似的这种课程，实际上对我们孩子来说，是非常需要的。
"Last but not the least, emotional technology.",最后一个，情感技术。
There is a popular animation recently.,这段时间有一部动画片。
It has a character called Dabai.,里边一个主角啊，大家都很喜欢它的名字叫大白。
"Although Dabai is a robot, everyone loves him.",尽管大白是一个技术的产品，但是大家都很喜欢它。
Why?,为什么？
Because he is so warm and caring.,因为它给温暖，它是个暖男。
Have you wondered what are the ultimate goals of technology advancement and our learning? Where does they lead us?,但是大家有没有想过，我们真的通过技术，通过学习我们想拥有什么？
"In fact, through the entire learning process, what we acquire is an emotional experience.",实际上，对于我们整个学习过程当中而言，我们真正地是需要一个情感。
"As I mentioned earlier, it is impossible to learn knowledge by inserting information into our brain because learning is a process.",我刚才讲到了，学习为什么不可能通过copy的方式就让我学到知识，必须要有一个过程。
"In this process, we experience emotions.",实际上这个过程就是让你体会学习的情感。
The emotional experiences are what really matter.,因为有这个情感学习才真的有意义。
The advancement of technology will finally contribute to the emotional experiences in education. ,而我们整个技术的发展，必然是要成为一个教育的情感技术。
"For example, if our textbooks are digitalized and made available electronically.",举一个例子，比如说，我们的教科书，如果变成电子书。
Where does the emotional experiences come from?,它永远只能拷贝的话，拷贝是没有情感的，但是它的情感来于什么地方？
The textbook will have traces of your learning.,这个教科书，将会留下你学习的过程。
It has a life.,有你的印记。
It is living.,甚至这本书电子书是有寿命的。
You can connect with it.,因为有寿命它就有生命它就有情感。
This is the emotional experiences technology offer.,这就是情感的技术。
"There is a poem saying, ""Time was slower in the past; the distance that carriage and horse walked were long while it took much time for mails to be delivered. You need your whole life to love the person that suits.""",有一首诗，叫“从前车马很慢，书信很远，一生只够爱一个人。”
Now the high-speed rail is fast.,现在高铁很快。
WeChat message takes no time.,微信很短。
It seems that you can love many people in this life.,一生好像可以爱很多人。
"Once emotion can be copied, it becomes meaningless.",情感一旦可以复制，实际上它就没有意义。
"Therefore, the future of educational technology will be oriented to offering more emotion experiences.",所以，对我们来说教育的整个一个技术，它必然会走向一个情感技术。
We are looking forward to this change.,而这一点，我们还在期待当中。
Thank you!,谢谢大家！
"A few days ago, I got a call from one of the boys from my class, ""Xing Jiawen, I heard that you are going to give a speech titled Boys Are Useless on the 29th day.""",前两天有男同学给我来电话，问我，刑佳雯，听说你二十九号要去演讲“男生是废物”啊。
"What an overblown worry it is. Life is short. If boys really are useless, why do we girls waste our time saving them?",你们想想，如果男生真是废物，人生短暂，我们女生还会这么尽心尽力地拯救他们吗？
"Actually, there is a story behind this call.",这个电话有个背景。
Last year we held a class meeting themed on Saving the Boys.,去年我们班搞了一个主题班会，拯救男生。
"Even studying in the best class in my school, one of the decent schools in Shanghai, we girls still often come across such things.",我们学校也算是上海市不错的学校了，我们班则是全年级成绩最好的班，但是我们经常发现这些现象。
"For example, we girls have to make all the PPTs for classroom activities and write the scripts for textbook-based dramas, and we were always the last to leave on cleaning days while the boys were nowhere to be seen.",比如班级活动里做ppt的活都是女生全包；课本剧活动，写剧本的永远都是女生；打扫班级卫生坚持到最后的也都是女生，男生呢，早就不知所踪了。
"What's more, we outperform the boys in exams.",就连成绩也往往是女生更胜一筹。
"As a result, girls and teachers can't help wondering: where are the good boys?",于是，广大女生们和老师不禁深感忧虑，纷纷发问我们的好男生都去哪儿了？
"Therefore, we held a class meeting themed on ""Saving the Boys"".",于是“拯救男生”主题班会顺利出炉。
"Compelled by the pressure of the theme, every boy in my class seemed to ""come forward"" and gabbled about how to be a good boy, and his plans about the future.",每个男生都压力很大的貌似主动的发言，谈自己应该怎么成为一个好男生，谈自己对未来的打算。
"They even invited my father, whom they thought to be a role model of successful man, to the meeting to share his opinions.",甚至他们还邀请到了我老爸作为成功男人给大家演讲。
"Well, I don't think he's that successful.",当然我并不太认为他是一个多么成功的人。
"Neverthelss, I do hope he set an example for the boys in my class and encouraged them to be better men.",嗯，希望他做一个成功人士能够给男生们树立一个榜样，激励大家。
"On the meeting, the girls cited examples from the past and modern days, so to speak, the whole meeting was full of our sincere care and expectations for the boys.",而我们女生呢，则是旁征博引，谈古论今，可以说整场班会凝聚了我们女生对于男生的殷切期盼和关怀。
"As an ending note, the girls and teachers all agreed that the meeting was a huge success.",结束了以后，我们女生们和老师一致认为这场班会大获成功。
"After the meeting, we held inspiring events, such as the Top 10 Good Boys, asking the girls to vote for the good boys in their eyes.",后来我们还举行了包括女生票选十大好男生之类的活动，让女生来投票选举好男生，多么能鼓舞男生啊。
"As a old saying goes, ""only time will tell.""",听说时间是检验感情投入的最好方式。
"Regrettably, one year after the meeting, the girls are still toiling over PPTs.",果然，一年后的今天，我们的女生还在辛苦地做ppt。
"Last August, I joined a coming-of-age ceremony in the Gobi Desert.",去年八月，我参加了戈壁成人礼。
"In the sorching hot season, me and other nearly 70 teenagers my age from other places in China revisited the toughest part that Xuanzang, a Chinese monk who travelled to India in the seventh century for Buddhist scriptures, had travelled through in his journey to the west.",在那个骄阳流火的季节里，我和全国近七十位少年一起踏上了戈壁，踏上了当年玄奘西行取经最艰难的一段路。
We had to travel 88 kilometers in just 4 days.,四天要完成八十八公里。
"As a head student for years and the mastermind of Saving the Boys, I had already prepared to be a tough girl in the journey.",毕竟是做了好几年的班长，毕竟是经历了轰轰烈烈的拯救男生行动，因此早在上戈壁之前我就已经做好了成为戈壁女汉子的心理准备。
"I started to worry since the first day in the Gobi Desert, as I found that the boys  significantly outnumbered the girls and they assumed all the key posts, such as team leader, the standard-bearer, etc.",当登上了戈壁，我发现队伍里男生的人数远远多于女生，而且担任队长、旗手等等的也无一不是男生，我开始忧虑我的团队。
"A boy nicknamed ""tights"" for being one of the thinnest boys in the team was our scout .",我们队有个绰号叫“紧身衣”的，他是全队最瘦弱的男生之一，也是我们的先锋。
"In the middle of our journey, we got lost and no one was sure where to go.",有一次，我们有点迷路了，不知道之后应该怎么走。
He came forward and volunteered to scout the way ahead.,这个时候他主动请缨说，让我去探路吧。
His heoric act worried us all because it's dangerous to be lost in a wild and sandy desert.,要知道在戈壁这种举目狂沙的地方，你要是真走丢了，那可不是闹着玩儿的。
"Despite of all the potential dangers, he went on his way.",但是他还是上路了。
"When his thin figure appeared alongside a huge rock, we all got excited.",当他瘦小的身影再一次出现在某一块巨石旁边的时候，我们真的都激动了。
With his help we were finally able to go back on the right path.,当他们为我们传来捷报，带我们走回正路的时候。
I was deeply impressed by his courage and devotion to the team.,我深深地为他给团队的奉献和他的勇气而打动。
The other boy I want to talk about is our team leader.,另外一位是我们的队长。
We didn't follow the tradition to elect the leader by voting on the candidates' speeches.,我们队比较独特，当初选队长，并不是凭演讲、凭公平竞争。
"Instead, we picked out a man who looks most experienced and prudent.",而是刷脸，也就是，我们选择了一位长得最沉稳老成的人来当队长。
"His name is Ling Feng,a boy who is shy and quiet.",他就是我们的凌风同学，他其实是一个比较腼腆，不太爱讲话的人。
"The main duty of the leader is to wrap things up, so Ling Feng had to stay at the tail of the team, never having the chance to be the first to reach the finishing line.",队长的工作主要是收尾，所以说他每天都要走在队伍的最末端，从来没有体会过第一个冲线的喜悦、自豪。
"Furthermore, he had to take care of the wounded and remind other members to saty hydrated.",此外他还要协助领队照顾伤员，提醒队员及时补水。
"At the same time, he had to be the liaison, always carrying portable chargers and the medical kit with him.",充当对讲机、充电宝、移动药箱等等。
"Despite of the heavy and complicated tasks, he never complained to us.",工作非常繁琐也很疲劳，但是在他沉稳老成的脸上，我们从来没有读出过抱怨。
The list of similar stories in the desert goes on and on.,在戈壁上类似的男生故事还有很多。
"In our journey, those brave boys were exactly the heroes we expected them to be.",那时他们真的都成了我们女生心中所期待的男子汉形象。
"Thanks to their dedication, we were able to feel safe and protected as if we were roses in the desert, only without thornes.",那时我们女生也就安心扮演戈壁小玫瑰，而且这是戈壁玫瑰最美好的时候，因为还没长刺儿呢。
"Speaking of the word ""role"", it simply means what we think we are and how we act accordingly.",说呀有角色这么一个词，简单来讲角色就是指一个人认为他自己是什么，并采取了怎样的一种行为模式。
"At the thought of words like the Gobi Desert, independence and man, even the boys who set out on their first journey in the desert would man up unconsciously to protect the girls.",戈壁、独立、汉子，女生需要被保护，一想象到这些词汇，即使是刚刚踏上戈壁的男生也会情不自禁地变成一个男子汉。
"See, the role is so magical that it can change our behavioral patterns.",这就是角色的魅力，它能够改变一个人的行为模式。
"But here comes another question, that is, why do ""tights"" and the leader have better performance than the rest of the boys in my team?",可是这里又出现一个问题了，为什么紧身衣和队长能够在这些男子汉里面表现得更为优秀呢？
"In order to solve this problem, I will introduce another term, role definition.",还有一个词叫角色定位，一个无可替代的定位，就叫做角色定位。
"Role definition means the particular position or function you have in a situation or in the society.  In my team, ""tights"" is not just a boy, but also the one and only scout.",在戈壁上、在我们的队伍里，紧身衣所担当的角色并不仅仅是一个男子汉，更是我们的先锋，这个角色只有他是。
This is exactly his role definition.,这个独一无二的角色就是他的角色定位。
This is the same case with my leader.,而我们的队长也是如此。
"Being the only leader in that team, Ling Feng has to fulfill many duties by himself.",凌风所要担当的角色是队长，因此很多事情，都只能由他来完成。
"Being unique and irreplaceable, that's the definition of the roles of those two boys.",独一无二、无可替代，这就是角色定位。
"By playing an irreplaceable role, one can transcend from being good to being excellent.",因为无可替代的角色定位，我们能够使优秀的变成卓越。
"If I recall correctly, I earned my place as the head student first when I was in the 6th grade.",记得我真正的班长生涯应该是从六年级算起的。
"At that time, the head student was required to write a brief summary every week, and read it out on every Monday.",当时班长被要求在每周写一篇班级小结，然后在周一的时候拿到讲台上去念。
"It's hard to forget the first time I stood at the podium, holding a tiny summary paper in my hand.",我永远忘不了，六年级的我第一次拿着那张轻薄的班级小结走上班级的讲台时。
My heart beat so hard and I felt like there was a rabbit jumping furiously in my chest.,心里像揣了兔子一般紧张的情景。
"The only thing I could do at that moment was keep telling myself ""you are the head student"".",但当时我在心里对自己大喊，你是班长，是班长啊。
It took me one week to overcome that nervousness.,就这样喊了一周以后，我不再紧张了。
"As we moved to higher grade levels, I often had to stay up late at night tending the class affairs, after which I had to finish enormous schoolwork before going to bed.",后来年级升高，作业量加大，每天完成班级的工作，常常就已经到深夜了，这个时候我再面对大量的作业。
"Looking at the elementary exercises I had done for countless times, sometimes I really wanted to muddle through them by copying answers.",看着里面那些做了千遍万遍的基础题，有的时候真的想一抄了之。
It is said that staying up late will accelerate the ageing of a woman.,听说女人经常熬夜会变老。
That's definitely something I want to avoid as a young girl.,我还不想这么早变老呢。
"Whenever I want to take a quick look at the answers,  a voice would scream in my heart, ""you are the head student"".",但是每当我的眼睛瞟向答案的时候，总有一个声音在我心底掠过，你是班长，是班长啊。
It is this voice that saved me from dishonoring my title.,我怎么能对不起班长这两个字呢。
"Then, I accepted the truth that I might age faster than my classmates.",于是，我坦然地接受了我似乎是要比别人更早变老的事实。
"Little did I know about role definition at that time, but now whenver I look back on that experience, I can be sure this is the magic of role definition.",当时我还不知道角色定位的概念，但是现在想起来，觉得这确实是角色定位的魅力。
"It is with that magic one can forge ahead, havingt hesitation or regret, and withstand the tear and wear of time.",它能够使一个人在他的道路上无怨无悔义无反顾地走下去，并且永远无惧于一切辛风苦雨。
Are boys really in need of salvation?,男生真的需要拯救吗？
"In my eyes, all we need to do is tell them that they are men, pioneers and leaders.",在我看来，只要我们告诉他们，你是男人、是先锋、是队长就足够了。
"In this lesson, we will discuss in detail how to write codes.",本节我们来讨论一下具具体来讨论一下怎么写代码。
There are two issues that need to be addressed.,啊这里面我们想讨论两个问题。
"First of all, we need to establish a concept that codes are also a way of expression.",首先给大家要建立一个意识啊，就是代码也是一种表达方式。
"Then, we will discuss the details about writing codes, including how to write a module, how to write a function, and how to write and name a code block.",呃然后呢我们会讨论一些代码书写中的一些具体的细节，包括怎么写一个模块儿，怎么写一个函数，然后怎么写一个代代码块儿，怎么命名等等。
"Now, I'd like to discuss about the concept that codes are also a way of expression.",首先我们想跟大家讨论的是说，代码它也是一种表达方式。
"In a project, on which part do we spend most of our time?",啊在一个项目的过程中，啊我们的时间都花到哪儿去呢？
Some of you may say that we spend much time in writing codes and documents.,可能有些同学就说诶我们去写代码，我们去写文档。
"Well, according to a software engineering book, 50% of our time is actually spent on communication in a project.",啊那么在这个有一本软件工程书里，它讲到，在一个项目中，50%时间实实际用于沟通的，啊。
"Moreover, in the life cycle of software, we spend much more time in maintenance than in development.",另外一点就是在软件这个整个这个开发过程中，或者维护过程中，这个生命周期中呢这个维护的时间是这个成本是远高于开发的成本的。
How do we communicate in a project of software development?,啊，那么在我们的这个做软件开发这个项目过程中，沟通都有哪些方式呢？
"There are many ways, and some of them may have never come to our mind.",有很多的方式，可能是大家以前没有想过的哈。
"For example, we can talk face to face, or write E-mails, documents and codes.",包括我们包括面对面的沟通，包括E-mail，包括文档，包括代码。
"Yes, codes are actually a way of communication.",啊这里面说代码其实也是我们的沟通的一种方式啊。
"So, I'd like to emphasize that codes are mainly written for people.",那么在这个现在来说呢，这个我要我想强调代码主要是写给人来看的啊。
"In the early days of computerization, when we wrote programs in machine code, assembly language, or C language, we might think more about how to execute programs more efficiently with our codes.",之前在这个计算机的早期，可能我们那时候写机器码写汇编，可能我们更多是考虑啊这个或者写C语言的时候，更多考虑这个代码怎么能更高效率的执行。
"Nowadays, code compilers are remarkably efficient, thanks to the progress we've made these years.",那么在现在这个些年的进由于这些年的进步呢，那么这个代码的这个编译器已经非常好了。
Many of the code compilers have spared us the need of writing special codes.,很多的这编译器已经就是不需要你写出一些很特殊的这个代码。
"So now when we write codes, we mainly focus on how to better get them through to other people.",那我们现在这个主要写代码是要考虑怎么能让其他人啊看的更加清楚。
This is why we should have coding standard.,所以呢这就引出我们为什么要有编程规范。
"Then, what does coding standard usually involve?",那么在编程规范中我们一般包含哪些内容呢？
"First, the programming methods, and the dos and don'ts when we use programming languages.",首先是包括这些代码要如何的这个这个表达，另外呢我们还要注意一些跟这个编程语言相关的一些注意的事项。
So what's our most ideal scenario?,那么我们最理想的一种一种场景是什么样呢？
We can understand the codes written by others as if they have been written by ourselves .,就是说我们看别人的代码和看自己的代码一样。
"When reading these codes, we think more about their logic instead of their formats.",而且在我们在这个在看代码的时候能够能够不用去太多考虑这些格式的问题，而是更多的去想这个代码逻辑到底是什么样的。
"In short, the most ideal scenario is ""don't make me think"", as a book decribes.",啊总之就是像有一个这本书上讲的就是说Don’t make me think。
It means that we don’t have to think too much when writing or reading codes.,就说在我在写看代码时候，不要让我去想太多，啊。
"Next, I'd like to talk about the problems we have often encountered in writing modules and functions.",那么下面讲一下，就我们在写代码中就是经常遇到的，比如模块儿这样的或者函数啊这样一些问题。
Let's take a look at this picture.,那么模块儿呢，大家可以看这张图。
We can see that a module is a basic component of a program.,就是模块儿这个是一个程序的一个基本的组成单位。
"In a module there may be data, functions or classes.",啊模块儿之下我们可能在一个模块儿内可能会有它的数据啊，有它的函数啊或者它的这个这些类。
"Then, a .PY, .C or .Go file is a module in a Python, Go or C program, respectivley.",那么在这个对于像python啊、像go啊、像C这样的程序来说呢，一个一个.PY或者一个.C或者一个.go的文件，它就是它就是一个模块儿，啊。
"When it comes to writing modules, we often put emphasis on cohesion rather than coupling.",那我们经常在讲模块儿要注意的事项是说经常说到紧内聚、松耦合。
"In other words, it's important that each module has a specific function.",也就说在这里面呢很重要一点，就是每个模块儿它要有明确的一个功能。
So we should delibrate over how to split programs into modules throughout the process of compiling software.,啊所以在这个整个软件呃编写的过程中呢，这个模块儿如何切分是一个非常需要慎重考虑的问题。
"Well, I'd like to present one of my frequently used methods of splitting programs into modules.",啊，那我们接着介绍就是说我们，我这面介绍一个我自己的一个经常使用的方法，怎么来切分模块儿。
"Before splitting programs into modules, we should know which are data modules, and which are process modules.",那么这个角度就说去区分哪些是这个呃数据类的模块儿，哪些是这个过程类的模块儿。
A data module in data encapsulation or object-oriented programming module mainly encapsulates data.,那么一个数据类的模块儿，就是我们经常讲这个数据这个封装或者面向对象这样一个编程。
It is realized by the variables in a module or the internal variables in a class.,那么这个数据模块儿主要要完成一个对一个数据的一个封装，那么这个封装往往是通过一个模块儿内的变量或者一个类的内部变量来来实现。
You can look at the right side.,大家可以看到看一下右边。
I'll show you an example of Python classes.,我我使用这个python这个类来举的一个例子啊。
"Here we have internal data, which is defined as the self.table.",我们这里面有一个内部的一个数据啊，它是一个self.table是这么定义的。
"Then, we have to provide other interfaces which can be called by this data module.",那么对一个这个数据模块儿来说呢，呃我们还要对外提供其他这个模块儿可调用的接口。
And the functions of these interfaces should be clearly defined.,呃而且这个接口应该是功能非常明确的。
"In addition, the interface implementation and internal algorithms are both included in the module.",除了接口以外，这些接口的实现、内部的算法都属于这个这个模块儿内部的事情。
You can see the example on the right side.,那么大家可以看到这个右边举的这个例子哈。
"In this demo, we have provided the Table module with two interface functions.",这个demo这个Table这个模块儿我们提供了呃两个接口函数。
"One is called ""set"", and the other ""get"".",一个接口函数叫set，一个接口函数叫get。
"That is, one interface is generally used for writing or setting, and the other is used for getting.",啊就是一个是这是我们经常通用的啊写或者设置，另外一个接口用它去读啊。
"In the process of writing programs, we often have to define the data modules in the systems first.",那么在这写中程序的过程中，我们经常第一步要做的是把这些呃系统中这些数据的模块儿定义出来。
This has something to with the data-centric programming philosophy.,啊这往往就谈到说我们的一种呃编程想法就是叫做以数据为中心。
The reason why many programs are difficult to maintain is because the programmers fail to define the data modules.,呃很多的程序它最后不好维护，是因为它没有把这些数据这个模块儿单独呃单独抽出来啊单独去考虑啊。
"That is, the data is not properly encapsulated.",也就是说没有把数据封装做好。
A common example is to take data as a global variable and put it in all the components of each program.,经常见到一种例子，就是把这个数据以全局变量的方式放在各个程序的各个位置。
"The second category of module is process module, which does not contain data.",然后第二类的这个模块就是我们讲叫过程类的模块儿，它是里面是不含有这个数据的。
"The process module can read a data entry from a file, or carry out related operation.",这个过程类模块儿可以是呃从文件中去读取一个数据，啊或者说我执行一些一些相关的操作。
Let me give you an example here.,啊这里面举了一个例子。
This module can call other data modules and process modules.,就是这个要过程类模块可以调用其它的数据模块儿，也可以去调用其他的过程类的模块儿，啊都是可以的，啊。
I'd like to reiterate the importance of this module.,然后这里面想再重申一下这个模块儿的这个重要性。
"Just now, I talked about the importance of modules for software development.",啊刚才就是说到这个也在软件编写过程中模块儿的重要性了。
Properly splitting programs into modules is the cornerstone for the stabilty of software.,就好的模块儿划划分是我们整个这个软件稳定的一个基础。
"When building a house, we first build its structure, and then decorate the house.",就是我们在盖房子时候，首先是有这个房子的一个框架，然后我们可以在这个房子里面去做一些装修啊。
"If the structure is solid, we can easily change the decoration.",如果说这个这个房子整个结构没问题，我们做一些装修的修改，这个还是比较容易的。
"Otherwise, it will cost a lot to demolish the house and build a new one.",但如果整个房子的结构有问题，我们需要把这房子整个推倒，然后重新再去做，那这个成本就非常高了。
Software development is similar to building a house.,呃对应到软件的开发中呢也是同样道理。
"That is, if the programs are split properly, the potential refactoring of the software will be within the scope of each module.",就是如果你的模块儿的切分是比较好的，那么这个未来软件的重构很多重构是局限在这个模块儿内的这个修改。
So there is no need to change the relationship of different modules.,而不用去去改变模块儿之间的关系。
"If the software is poorly designed in the first place, it will be difficult to refactor later because all modules need to be rewritten.",反之如果这个开始的这个设计没有做好，那做重构的时候，需要把这个所有的这个软件全部要重写，那么这个难度就非常高了。
"Moreover, we should try to reduce the coupling between modules as much as possible, as I have mentioned before.",啊还有一个点就是我们在要尽力减少模块儿间的耦合，这刚才已经也提到了。
"If the relationship between modules is chaotic, such as using of a lot of global variables or the relationship between interfaces being unclear, the software will become exponentially complex.",如果说这个模块儿间的这个关系是比较混乱的，比如使用了很多全局变量或者接口的关系并不是很明确，那么这个软件的复杂度会这个呈指数级的上升。
"The clear relationship between modules, in fact, is conducive to the reuse of software in the future.",然后就是如果有清晰的模块关系，其实我们对未来软件的复用是非常有利的。
"If the modules of the software are given specific functions, they can be easily seperated and reused in other systems in the future.",啊就如果这个软件的模块儿是有非常明确的功能，那么未来在做其他的这个系统的时候，如果需要重用的时候，是很容易把这个模块儿切分出来，转移到另外一个系统中去重用的。
We have discused the modules.,第一个首先我们才讨论刚才讨论这个模块儿。
"Now let's move to, classes and functions, which are two completely different models.",然后下面我们讨论下一层就是这个类和函数啊，那么类和函数是两个完全不一样的模型啊。
There used to be a misconception that function seemed out of date after object-oriented programming emerged.,之前有一个有一个误解，就是感觉好像面向对象出来之后，这个函数就是一种比较落后的这个编程的方式啊。
"In fact, these two models have their respective scopes of application.",但事实上就是这两种呃模型它是有各自不同的这个这个适用范围的。
"As far as I'm concerned, it may not be a good idea to describe the whole world with one uniform model.",啊我个人观点认为说，如果你想用一种统一的模型来描述所有的这个整个的世界，其实这并不一定是一个很好的主意。
I think that Java is a negative example.,啊比如说java就是我认为就是一个反例。
It's a powerful object model.,它在里面是非常强的这个对象模型。
You can write a simple process and implement it by using just one function in C.,啊即使你写一个非常简单的一个一个过程，在C里面使用一个函数就可以实现。
"However, you have to write a full class in Java.",而在java里要写一个完整类来实现。
So it actually makes a simple issue more complicated.,这其实是使这个本来简单的问题变得更加复杂。
"Second, I'll share with you my experience in the experiment.",啊然后第二个就是我这一个在这个实验中的一个一个经验是什么呢。
"That is, if you have implemented a function irrelevant to the member variables in a class, it's recommended to extract it and use it as a separate function.",就是如果说你在这个一个类里面去实现了一个这个和它的成员变量没关的函数，是建议你把它啊抽出作为一个单独的函数存在的。
Why?,这是为什么呢？
This will make it easier to reuse this function.,就是这样会更容易地去使这个函数得到重用。
"We have a function called Function, which is not related to the member variables in our class.",就是在这里面是我们是有一个这个函数是叫Function，那么这个Function它的实现是跟我们类的这个成员变量没有任何关系的。
"In this experiment, we have extracted this function from the class, and taken it as a separate function.",那么在这个实验中我们就把这个函数抽到类之外，作为一个单独的函数存在，啊。
This is a simple example.,这是一个简单例子啊。
"Now, I'd like to talk about object-oriented programming.",然后呢下面我想这个关于这个面向对象来做一些讨论啊。
"First of all, I think that it is a good idea.",首先这个面向对象呢，我想说它是一个好很好的主意啊。
"However, only a small number of people really understand and master it in China.",但是真正在在我们国内呢对这个这个方法真正理解和掌握的人并不多啊。
"Many people write non-object-oriented programs in a language with object-oriented capabilities, such as C++.",很多同同学呢他是拿着这个带有面向对象能力的语言呃写着非这个面向对象的程序，啊比如拿着C++的这样的语言。
"In fact, these programs are poor in data encapsulation.",但实际他写出的这个程序呢它的数据的封装性是非常差的。
What is the core of object-oriented programming?,在这个面向对象里面实际它的最本质的是什么呢？
It is data encapsulation.,是我们要做这个数据的封装。
"Therefore, when we start to write programs, rather than only focusing on the logic of code execution, we have to think about the associated data in the system and how to encapsulate it from a data-centric perspective.",所以在写程序的开始就要从这个数据的角度去想说这个这个系统中哪些关联数据我们怎么对它去封装，而不是从这个代码的执行的这个逻辑来考虑啊。
"Unfortunately, many people tend to think about the entire process of code execution when they get a project for system design.",但是确实很不幸，就是现在很多同学在拿到一个这个系统设计的时候，还是很习惯性的去想这个代码的整个的执行过程是什么样的，啊。
There is another misconception.,然后还有一个故误解是什么呢。
"It's that C++ language is object-oriented, and C language is process-oriented.",就是这个C++是面向那个呃对象的，然后C语言是是面向过程的。
This is a common cognitive error.,那么这是一个普遍的认知错误啊。
"Well, C language is in fact object-based.",那么C语言它讲的是说是它的概念是是叫基于对象。
"That is, its major difference with C++ language is that it does not involve polymorphism and inheritance.",就是说它主要和C++主要差别是它没有多态和继承。
"The abuse of C++ language is quite often, because it has powerful functions and many variable components.",而这个而C++来说呢，它现在经常是一个就是被滥用的语言，因为C++有太强的这个功能，有太多的这个可以变化的地方。
What is the most important task for a software engineer?,作为软件工程师来讲，我们最重要的这个任务是什么呢？
"It's to achieve the expected functions, rather than to be verbalists, to explore the different uses of C++ language, and to know the different results of execution.",是去实现出我们所需要的功能，而不是去咬文嚼字儿，去探究说这个C++这种语言中到底有多少不同的用法，然后不同的这个执行的结果到底是什么样的。
"Moreover, I want to stress that the polymorphism and inheritance in C++ language should be used carefully in our system.",然后另外想强调说这像多态、像继承这样的C++这样的方法，在这个我们的系统中是要谨慎使用的。
"If there are more than three layers of inheritance in a system, it's hard to know the complexity.",如果一个系统中有有这个这个类的继承有超过三层，那么你其实是已经很难很难把握这个这个复杂度的。
Another paradox is that you can't properly design inheritance until you clearly understand a system.,还有一个悖论是什么呢，就是说呃只有当你对一个系统有很清晰的理解之后，你才能设计出很好的继承关系。
"However, we often start designing software without a clear understanding of the system.",但是呢我们在这个软件开始的阶段往往是没有一个很好的理解。
"The software might be a simple prototype in the beginning, and gradually takes shape.",可能是开始是一个很很简单的原型，然后才逐步发展起来。
"Given its object-oriented nature and multiple inheritance layers, C++ language dims the possibility of a good initial design for the software.",所以到底是在初始阶段是不是能给出这样一个好的设计呢，其实对C++这方面来说是非常做这个面向对象或做多层继承来说是非常困难的。
"Therefore, we have to perfect the software through constant iterative development and refinement of the system.",啊，所以就是我们往往是这个一个系统是是通过这个不断地迭代、不断地完善才最后把它做做好。
"Now, let's talk about the components of the .C file in a C program or the .PY file in a Python program.",这里面我们现在下一步想讨论一下，在对一个模块儿啊也就刚才说的一个在C里面是一个.C文件，或者在python里面是一个py文件，在这里面都有哪些组成啊。
"First, we have to write a file header to briefly describe the functions of the module.",首先包括说就是你要写一个文件头，来对这个这个模块儿的功能做一个简单的说明。
"Secondly, we need to keep a proper record of revising the document, including the time of modifying the contents and the names of the programmers.",其次呢我们要把这个文件的这个修改历史写清楚，啊包括什么时间谁来对这对这个内容做修改。
"However, we often find that the names of the programmers are not shown in a lot of codes.",啊我们经常发现很多的这个代码它里面是没有写清楚这个呃谁来写的这个代码，啊。
We also have to write other necessary instructions for the module.,然后其他的我们要写要写一些这个其他的这个模块儿的必要的相关的说明。
"In this module, we need to ensure that the contents are in a consistent sequence.",啊，在这个一个模块内，我们需要尽量保证这个内容它的顺序是一致的。
Why?,这是为什么呢？
"If the contents of the module are not in a consistent sequence, you have to search through the file for an item.",就是如果所有人这个写的这个模块儿的内部顺序都不一致，那么当你需要找一个内容时候，你需要在文件里去丝搜索。
"If the contents are in a consistent sequence, you can easily find what you want in the module.",而如果如果这个顺序是一致的，你基本就是可以这个很方便的找到你想要找到的内容。
Here is an example of the file header in a Python program.,这里面是以这个python这个来举例，啊做的一个文件头的例子啊。
The first is the path of the Python interpreter.,第一个是这个python这个解释器的路径。
I have written the basic overview of the module.,然后下面写了这个这个模块儿的一些基本概要的说明。
"Then I have written the history of writing the module, including the description of some key functions.",然后再下面一步是这个这个模块儿的编写的历史，包括一些这个里面的关键的一些一些这个功能的说明。
This is a simple example.,啊这是一个很简单的例子。
I'm a lawyer.,我是一名律师。
"I was asked by one of my friends a few days ago, ""You've been in the business for more than 10 years, what's the most unforgettable thing in your mind?""",前几天有个朋友问我：“你从业十几年了，印象最深的一件事儿是什么？”
"I think about it, and suddenly realize that the most unforgettable thing is not a case with over 100 million yuan of Subject of Contract, nor court hearings that took place at the Supreme People's Court.",蓦然回首仔细静想一下，原来还真不是那些标地上亿元的案子，也不是那些在最高人民法院开过的几个庭。
You must find it unbelievable.,你能想到吗。
My most unforgettable case is one that involved only 475.83 yuan.,却是一件关于四百七十五块八毛三分钱的案子。
"In 2005, I handled a small case. At that time, I had only a few years' law practicing experience.",2005年，我初入这个行业还没几年，接手了一个小案子。
My client was a newcomer to our city.,我的当事人从外地来。
He rented an apartment there.,在我们那个城市租住了一套居住用的房子。
Later he found a job in another city and therefore he needed to move out of the apartment early.,后来因为工作调动的问题，他需要提前退房。
"That is to say, he needed to cancel the house leasing contract with his landlord.",也就是说啊，需要提前向房东提出解除房屋租赁合同的请求。
It was nothing complicated.,本来嘛，也不是什么大事儿。
"My client had paid deposit to his landlord, and it was up to the landlord to deduct any reasonable cost from the deposit.",我的当事人在房东那儿有押金，双方算算账。
It was a simple mathematics.,该扣的扣该减的减。
And eventually the landlord was required to return 475.83 yuan to my client.,最后呢，房东应该退还我的当事人四百七十五块八毛三分钱。
"It was rather simple, nothing complicated.",按说这么简单的事儿，也没有什么可以聊的。
"But this landlord seemed to be obsessed by some devilish idea, kept making all kinds of excuses and refused to return 475 yuan to my client.",可是呢，就在那个时候，这个房东竟然鬼迷了心窍，想尽各种理由拒绝退还这475块钱。
"I guessed that he was thinking, ""You're a newcomer here, what can you do? You can never have this 400 yuan back.""",估计那时候房东心想啊，你一个外地人，有什么了不起，这四百多块钱就别想拿去了。
My client refused to accept it.,我的当事人岂肯吃这哑巴亏。
"He entrusted a lawyer, which was me, and filed a lawsuit against his landlord in court.",直接委托律师向法院提起了诉讼，一纸诉状将他告到了法庭。
"It is such an insignificant matter, and by no means it should be escalated and become a lawsuit?",这事儿说起来都觉得可笑，这么简单的一个事儿还用得着打官司吗？
"However, to my big surprise, this landlord, by leveraging his local connection, succeeded in winning the first-instance judgment.",可你真让人想不到的是，这个房东竟然动用地方关系。
"In other words, the court judgment said it was right for him not returning 475 yuan.",一审判决他不用退还这475块钱。
Let alone the feeling of my client.,且不说我的当事人什么感觉啊。
"It was a serious setback for me, a new lawyer in the business.",对我这刚入行的律师那简直就是一种打击啊。
It would directly affect my outlook on life and the judgment on values.,直接影响我对人生观价值观的判断哪。
"In any case, we must file an appeal.",无论如何是要提起上诉的。
"In the Court of second instance, we made our utmost efforts to fight for our point of view, presented convincing proofs and finally the final judgment came out.",在二审法院，经过我们据理力争、多方举证、四轮谈判、八方周旋，最后终审判决。
He was asked to return the money to my client.,终于要求他退钱。
"But to my disbelief, the case was never a simple one.",可是你能想到吗，这事还真没那么简单。
"The landlord refused to accept the court judgment, and this case eventually entered the execution phase.",这小的案子都进入了执行阶段。
The execution phase was not complicated either.,执行过程也没什么复杂的。
"The judge asked both litigants and me into his office, and required the landlord to give 475 yuan of cash to my client face to face.",法官把双方当事人还有我叫到了办公室，在大家当场面前，要求房东拿出475块钱现钞，当场点给了我的当事人。
One thing unexpected happened when we were about to leave the judge's office.,可是就在临出门的那一刻，让人意想不到的一件事情发生了。
"The landlord suddenly pointed angrily at my nose and shouted, ""Ren Zhijian, I'm not afraid of you. Let's wait and see.""",在临出门的时候，房东气冲冲的手指着我的鼻子，说:“任智健，两只肩膀扛一个脑袋，咱们走着瞧。”
"At that moment, my brain literately went blank.",那时那刻啊，我的思维都快停顿了。
I can't believe that this man will behavior in such a silly way for the sake of 475 yuan.,至于嘛，这475块钱。
I ended up leaving the Court from its back door.,反正那天我是从法院后门儿溜出去的。
It is a great fortune of me for not meeting this guy these years.,这么多年了幸好再也没有碰到这位兄弟。
I hope that he won't be present for today's event; otherwise I will be in trouble.,我估计他今天应该不在现场，否则的话，这这事儿真麻烦了。
"When looking back at this case, I now realize that it is more than a joke.",这件事啊，现在回想起来，已经不是哑然失笑这么简单。
"Why is someone willing to break rules, to break simple rules of a house leasing contract, in exchange for 475 yuan?",为什么有人为了475块钱甘愿去破坏我们社会的规则？甘愿去破坏一个简单的房屋租赁合同的规则？
Is this psychological impulse something we are born with?,这种心理的冲动是我们人天生就有的吗？
"In the past 30 years' reform and opening up, China has made significant progress and development in its legal system construction.",中国改革开放三十多年，法制建设确实得到了明显的进步和发展。
"However, we still see many bizarre social phenomena.",但是我们经常会看到一些光怪陆离的社会现象。
Most of my clients are enterprises or institutions.,我呢，现在服务的很多都是机构企业客户。
"I have noticed one thing, whenever there are legal disputes, these bosses will immediately think of establishing a personal connection with three government officials, namely the mayor, head of the public security bureau and chief justice.",我发现老板们经常遇到问题和纠纷的时候啊，首先想到的还是市长、局长、院长这三长。
"And for job reason, I often pay visits to these three government officials together with my clients.",我因为工作关系经常也会陪朋友们去拜见这三长。
"One day I accompanied my friend to visit one official, who was president of a local intermediate people's court.",有一天，我陪我的一个朋友，去拜访我们当地的中级人民法院的院长。
"During our conversation, I noticed that this chief justice, in his 50s, knew very little about existing legal provisions and made arbitrary decisions simply based on his experiences.",在聊天儿过程当中啊，我发现这位号称三长之一的，诶快接近五十岁的这位院长啊，对我们现行的很多规定啊，不熟悉不掌握，习惯于靠经验去判断事情。
"Out of kindness, I quietly handed over a printed copy of a specific legal provision to him.",于是乎啊，我将打印出来的一份有关于某个事情的现行的规定，悄悄地递给了这个院长。
"The chief justice took a quick look at it and talked to me sneeringly, ""It is nothing. We brothers have the final say of this matter.""",没想到这位院长一看这个玩意儿，轻蔑地对我说：“这算啥？事儿还不是咱们兄弟们说了算。”
"Wow, till this moment can you realize the power of bragging.",哇！在那个时候你真正能体会到，什么叫西门吹牛。
Why?,为什么？
Why do our current law enforcers and rulers often ignore the existence of rules and regulations?,为什么我们现在的执法者、执政者，时常有将规则无视它存在的情况？
Why do they often turn these rules and systems into tools to seek personal gains?,为什么他们经常会把规则制度当作自己的工具，当作自己的儿戏？
Why is there no such a sense of awe and admiration for the rules and systems in their hearts?,为什么他们心中没有对规则制度的这种敬畏和敬仰的感觉？
"Is this what George W. Bush said about ""power not being locked up in a cage""?",难道这是小布什说的“权力没有被关进笼子里”吗？
Many strange social phenomena happen in our society.,当下社会呢，发生很多奇怪的社会现象。
"We just mentioned that law enforcers and powerful people would violate rules, how about those ordinary people, people without any power, will they break any rule?",我们刚才讲作为执政者有权力的人是这样，那作为我们这种普通的没有权力的普通大众，是不是就不会违反规则？
Will they make any attempt to cross the red line?,不会逾越雷池半步呢？
"About 10 years ago, a very strange case happened in the Northeast China region.",大约在十年前，东北发生过一个很奇怪的案子。
Teachers from a school joined a group tour together during the summer vacation.,有一个学校，放暑假组织老师们去集体外出旅游。
"When the tour bus entered a rest area along a national road, a robber armed with a sharp blade appeared from nowhere.",当旅游大巴车行到国道上某一个休息区的时候，从车下窜上来一个手持利刃的劫匪。
"It was a very young robber, approximately 14 to 15 years old; and the sharp knife in his hand was very intimidating.",这个小劫匪呢，看上去年纪并不大，也就十四五岁的样子，但是手里头那把明晃晃的刀子啊，看了还是让所有人心惊胆战的啊。
"By waving the knife, this young robber ransacked the entire bus and demanded for money and personal belongings of every passenger.",就这样，劫匪从车尾到车头，把车上每一个人的财物洗劫了一遍。
"Just as the robber was about to get off the bus, he saw a beautiful young teacher sitting near the door of the bus, with a string of golden necklaces around her neck.",就在劫匪临下车的时候，看见车门口坐着一位年轻漂亮的老师，脖子上带着一串金灿灿的项链儿。
"The robber had an evil intention, and decided to grab the necklaces around her neck.",心生歹意啊，这个劫匪伸手就去拽脖子上的这个项链儿。
"This young teacher by instinct, assuming that this robber was going to rape her, started to resist aggressively.",这女老师呢，还以为劫匪临了还要性侵一下自己，于是乎就开始本能地反抗。
"And during this intense bodily contact, the female teacher's clothes were torn.",双方在揪扯过程当中，把女老师的衣服都撕破了。
"Without further thinking, she immediately grabbed a bundle of books and slammed to the robber's head.",女老师心急之下，抄起手边的一捆书猛地向劫匪头上砸去。
And the robber immediately lost consciousness.,这一砸不得了啊，把个小劫匪给砸晕了。
"It was only till this moment the remaining 20 teachers on the same bus got up and started punching and kicking the robber, who had already lost the resistance ability.",就在这个时候，车上二十几位老师全部起身，对已经失去反抗能力的小劫匪拳打脚踢。
"When the robber was transferred to local public security bureau, he was half dead and had only one remaining breath left.",到最后把劫匪送交公安的时候，已经打得几乎半死就剩下一口气了。
Why?,为什么？
"We found out that at that moment, these 20 people, who called themselves ""teachers"", had completely ignored the existence of the rules.",我们发现在那个时刻，称之为“老师”的这二十几个人，已经完全忽视了规则的存在。
"At that very moment, these 20 people freed the devils in their hearts, totally forgetting the existence of rules and regulations within a society.",在那一时刻，这二十几个人，释放出了心里的魔性，他们已经忘记了社会规则制度的存在。
They also forgot that even robbers would have a legitimate right to stand trial.,甚至忘记了即便是劫匪，也有接受审判的权利。
"In the subconsciousness of our countrymen, are there no such feelings of awe and admiration for the rules and regulatory systems?",难道在我们国人的心中，潜意识里面就没有这种对规则制度的敬畏和敬仰的感觉吗？
I don't think so.,我想，非也。
"We can look back at our Chinese nation, a country with more than 2000 years of ideological and cultural history.",我们回顾中华民族，两千多年的思想文化史。
"During the Spring and Autumn Warring States Period more than 2,500 years ago, our Chinese society gave birth to the important ideas of Confucianism, Taoism, legalism, Mohism and so on.",在2500多年前的春秋战国时期，我们的中国社会同时诞生了儒家、道家、法家、墨家等等重要思想。
"Studies of Chinese ancient civilization are very popular nowadays, but what I want to say is that these studies should not be considered as the studies of Confucianism alone.",但是我今天想说的是，当下社会国学之风盛行，但是国学绝不等同于儒学。
Let's talk about Mohist school of thought and  legalist school of thought today.,我们今天来谈谈墨法世家。
"When it comes to the understanding and reverence of the rules and regulatory systems, we must first talk about Mohist school of thought.",谈到对规则制度的理解和尊崇，当属墨家。
"Mohist is an organization formed by highly disciplined people, and its leader was called Juzi.",墨家是一个具有非常严密纪律的这样一个团体，墨家的领导人称之为巨子。
"About 400 A.D.during the Warring States Period,Fu, the 4th generation of the Juzi's heir, lived in the Kingdom of Qin and Fu's son killed someone.",大约在公元四百年的战国时期，巨子的第四代传人腹，住在秦国，腹的儿子杀了人。
In line with the laws Fu's son should be executed.,依律应当处死。
"King Huiwen of Qin thought that Fu was already an old man, and had only one son, so the King decided not to kill Fu's son.",但是当时的秦惠王觉得，腹年纪已经大了，而且就这么一个儿子，就命令不杀。
"But Fu replied, ""The Mohist Law stipulates that the murderer must die and the one who has hurt others must receive corresponding punishment.This is the necessary means to prohibit killing and robbing, and in line with the world's righteousness.""",但是腹却说：“墨家之法规定‘杀人者死，伤人者刑’，这是禁止杀人越货的必要手段，这是符合天下之大义的。”
So Fu decided to have his own son killed.,所以他决定还是把自己的儿子杀了。
"The story vividly displays the in-depth understanding of rules and regulatory systems by Mohists, and such an understanding has been lifted to a level that we can call awe or a religion.",这个故事生动地表明了墨家人对规则制度的理解，已经达到了一种敬畏甚至可以称为信仰的地步。
Is this very spirit not exactly what we need in a society that advocates rule of law?,这种精神，不正是我们现在法制社会所需要的吗？
Isn't it the very spirit for Chinese enterprises to manage their businesses nowadays?,甚至不正是我们现在中国企业管理所需要的吗？
But how does this spirit come into being in the first place?,但是这种精神怎么来的？
I think it is necessary for us to explore the core of Mohist thought.,这个时候呢，我觉得我们有必要探究一下墨家思想的核心。
"For more than 2000 years, the core value of Mohist thought has always been ""love"".",两千多年来墨家思想的核心一直都是“兼爱”。
"The idea is that all people, including monarch and his subjects, fathers and sons, brothers and sisters, should treat each other nicely on the basis of equality and mutual love.",“兼爱”的思想强调：君臣父子兄弟姐妹之间，在平等的基础上相互友爱。
"Influenced by this simple concept of equality, Mohists have grown a sense of respect or admiration for rules and regulatory systems, which is what we now call a rule-of-law soceity.",在这种朴素的平等观念下，造就了墨家人对规则制度的一种敬重和敬仰感，也就是我们现在所说的法制社会。
"We can see that the philosophy of universal love helps create equality in a society, and ensuingly the equality helps build a rule-of-law social environment.",我们可以看到，“兼爱”的哲学思想给出了平等的社会观念，平等的社会观念造就了法治的社会环境。
"Unfortunately, this important idea has not become the mainstream of society in the future.",但是可惜的是，这一重要思想日后并未成为社会的主流。
"About 2000 years ago, during the Western Han Dynasty in China, a scholar named Dong Zhongshu and his master, Emperor Wu of Han, jointly launched a policy to reject the other schools of thought and respect only Confucianism.",大约在两千年前的中国西汉时期，一个叫董仲舒的夫子和他的主人汉武帝共同推出了一个“罢黜百家、独尊儒术”的政策。
"Under the guidance of this policy, the entire society followed a feudal hierarchy of ""monarch-official, father- son"".",在这个政策的指引下，社会奉行君君、臣臣、父父、子子的封建等级观念。
"Once this concept is proposed, there isn't any equality in our society, and the social environment that sustains the growth of legal systems ceases to exist.",这个观念一出，社会再无平等可言，社会再无法制可寻。
"This kind of concept continues to linger today, and still remains as an influential factor in China's society.",这种观念，一直延续到今天，在当今的中国社会依然残余犹存。
"There are people who have violated rules and regulations, even broken the law; however,because of their special background or special status, they end up receiving special treatment, some even enjoy special previlidges when staying behind the bar.",我们可以看到，有一些人违反了社会规则，甚至违反了法律，但是因为他们特殊的背景、特殊的身份，反而获得一个特别的待遇，包括特别的监管领域。
"Some people, because of one of their family members being a senior government official, can enjoy special treatments when traveling, including escort by police cars and site cleaning prior of their visit to a tourist attraction.",有一些人，因为有了官宦世家的背景，所以他出行的时候也有特别的对待，包括出门警车开道、进景区还要清场。
"Some other people, because of their special status, are less fortune.",有一些人由于有了特殊的身份。
They might be captured by surveillance cameras when staying a hotel room with their girlfriends.,找个女朋友还要上宾馆开个房间，包括被监控摄像机拍下来。
"Rule-of-law concepts, including freedom and equality, are badly needed in our society; but these concepts are hard to come by.",在我们这个社会，我们更需要的是自由平等的法治的理念，但是当属来之不易。
"Luckily thanks to the arrival of the Internet era, we are able to see a glimmer of hope.",幸运的是互联网时代的到来，让我们看到了一丝希望和光明。
"In the Internet society that highlights de-identification and decentralization, people are able to communicate freely.",我们发现在互联网的社会当中，大家可以去身份化、去中心化地平等交流。
"In the Internet society, people create one after another communities based on simple but effective rules.",在互联网的社会当中，人们就是靠一种简单的、朴素的、有用的规则创造了一个一个社区。
"Within these communicities where the concept of equality prevails, we are able to communicate freely as an equal entity.",在这种平等观念的社区当中，我们可以平等化地进行交流。
"I firmly believe that with the evolution of social systems and social trends, the human race will demand for a society that values freedom, equlity and a rule-of-law environment.",我相信，社会制度浩浩荡荡，社会大潮流也浩浩荡荡，必将推动着我们整个人类去寻找平等自由的法制的社会创建。
Thank you.,谢谢各位。
"Before I begin my speech, I'd like to ask you a question.",我想先问大家一个问题。
Is there anyone who has never seen someone littering in the street?,在座的各位，有谁没有在大街上看到乱扔垃圾的人？
Raise your hand if you haven't.,没有看到的请举手。

"Since we are unhappy, then what kept you from stopping them?",既然我们不高兴，这为什么就不上去阻止他们呢？
I've asked several people about this question.,我问过几个人。
"Before I came to TnDao for speech, I made a visit to the barber's and had my hair cut.",今天为了来上“听道”我特地中午去理了个发。
"The hairdresser said, ""Just two days ago, I saw several well-dressed and apparently well-educated young people who finished their drinks, crumpled the cups and tossed them on the ground and left.""",然后我的发型师就跟我讲，他说：“唉，现在的年轻人，我前两天看到有几个穿着很光鲜一看就受过很好教育的人，在大街上喝完一杯饮料，团一团，地上一放，走了。”
"Then he came up and stopped them, ""Hey, why are you littering?""",然后我上去叫住他们：“哎，你们怎么乱扔东西？”
But he was greeted with strange looks.,结果人家用非常奇怪的眼神看着他。
So he asked me whether he was acting stupid.,那他就问我：“嘶，是不是我不正常。”
I have posed the same question to some other friends.,我还问过其他一些朋友，问他为什么不上去阻止他。
Some of them told me they were afraid of being beaten.,有朋友跟我这么说： “怕被打。”
I have dissuaded people from littering more than 100 times in the street in big cities such as Shanghai and Beijing.,我在上海北京这些大城市的街头，劝阻了不下一百次不要乱扔垃圾。
And I've got no beating.,没被打过。
Not a single one.,一次都没被打过。
"Better still, I have managed to persuade nearly all of them to pick up the litter.",不光一次没被打过，而且基本上都能让对方，把他扔下的垃圾给捡起来。
"So next time, when you walk down the street and see someone littering before you.",如果说下一次你在大街上行走，看到有人在你面前扔下一个垃圾。
"You could say, ""Hey, pal, you dropped something.""",哎，朋友，你东西掉了。
Most people will feel ashamed and pick up the litter straightaway.,超过半数的人其实他是有羞辱心的，他会马上把垃圾给捡起来。
The rest may respond by saying that they longer need it.,剩下有一小半的人，他们会说：“这是我不要的。”
"If they do say so, I would go on to ask, ""Well, you see, there is a dustbin over there. Would you mind taking a few more steps and throwing it in?""",这是他不要的，那我就继续跟一句：“哎，你看，前面就有垃圾桶，麻烦你多走几步扔到前面去？”
Most people will pick up the litter after two or three times of persuasion.,绝大部分的人，在你两到三次劝导以后，都能够把垃圾捡起来。
"In fact, dustbins may have outnumbered trees in streets in Shanghai, but why are some people unwilling to take just a few more steps?",其实现在上海街头垃圾桶可能比树还多，他为什么不挪一挪步呢？
I want to share with you an interesting story.,还有一个很有意思的故事。
"There was a time when I was standing beside Shanghai Jiuguang City Plaza, a well-known, fashionable department store, and a young man cast a half-smoked butt before me.",有一次，我在上海久光百货的旁边，久光百货大家知道，一个很时尚的商场，又碰到这样一个年轻人，在我面前，唰，扔下一个长长的烟头。
"I said, ""Hey, pal, you dropped something.""",哎，朋友，东西掉了。
"Ok, I'm sorry.",哦すみません。

I did catch Koreans littering in the Korean town near Shanghai Hongqiao.,我还在上海虹桥有个韩国城，还抓到过韩国人。
"One of them was drinking Red Bull beside a restaurant, and he threw the can on the ground when he finished it.",在其中的有一个，那边有一个酒店，酒店旁呢，有一个韩国人，在喝红牛，喝完以后，唰，把罐子扔在地上。

Many white-collar workers in Shanghai and Beijing are well-educated.,包括我们在上海、北京，很多白领也受过非常好的教育。
Do they really have no idea about it?,难道他们真不懂这个道理吗？
Why is that?,为什么会这样呢？
"In psychology, this phenomenon is termed as the broken window theory.",心理学上面把这个现象称作为，破窗效应。
The theory goes like this.,所谓破窗效应。
Consider a building with a broken window.,就是如果有一栋大楼，一扇窗户，被打破了。
"If the window is not repaired, more neighboring windows will soon be broken.",如果不及时修理，很快，周边的几座窗户，也会被相继地打破。
Because people will think this is for aiming.,因为大家觉得，噢原来这个就是变练靶子的。
"If one advertisement flyer appears on a white wall, the wall will be caked with illegal ads on curing sexually transmitted diseases.",如果有一堵洁白的墙，贴了一个小广告，过几天你去看，会贴满了老军医。
Because people may think the wall is reserved for such ads.,因为大家可能就认为，哦原来这就是广告墙。
"If you see one pile of litter in the street, walk around the street and come back, and you're likely to find a second pile nearby.",如果说大街上，有一个垃圾在地上，你走一圈回来，很有可能就有第二个垃圾在这里。
Because people may think the place is designed to be a dustbin.,因为大家可能就认为，原来这就是垃圾桶。
Such occurrences are a common sight in our daily life.,我们生活当中，这样的事例是非常多，大家可能经常遇到。
Consider we are waiting at traffic lights.,比方说，我们在过人行道的时候等红绿灯。
"If someone rushes through the red light, you'll find many people following his step in running the red light.",这时候，有一个人冲过去了，诶，你会发现，会有很多人跟着他走。
"There is another example. Since the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, we have been promoting the escalator etiquette of 'stand right, walk left'.",或者说上海进入世博以后，我们一直在推行左行右立。
"If one person takes the initiative to stand on the left, people behind him will naturally do the same.",当有一个人在自动扶梯上面，站住不走的时候，自然后面的人也就不走了。
I believe you must be irritated at these phenomena.,这样一些现象，我相信大家在座的看到的时候，心里边肯定都不好受。
"However, these phenomena are so common that we customarily ignore it by mentally pressing the 'delete' button in our head.",但是，我们因为看了太多了，所以呢，我们大脑里边呢，突然间多了一个按钮，这个按钮呢叫delete。
We just pretend that we have seen nothing.,就把你看到呢就当做没看到。
There is another word for this.,我们就把这个称作另外有四个字。
Do you know what's it called?,叫什么？
"It's ""indifference"".",熟视无睹。
But I'm willing to be different.,不过我呢，啧就愿意跟别人不一样。
"It seems that when I was born, my parents gave me no 'delete' button but a 'reboot' button.",我爹妈生我的时候呢，这个delete键好像没给我，只有重启键。
So I have to interfere and actually I like pondering over things.,我就必须得管管这个闲事儿，而且我这人诶好琢磨。

In a fashionable way?,管得时尚一点？
In a sexy way?,管得性感一点？
That's what I'm working on.,这就是我研究的。
"So today, I want to show you the three tricks of meddling.",所以今天告诉大家，我终于研究出了三招秘诀。
The first trick is called 'You're not alone'.,第一招，叫“你不是一个人在战斗”。
Do you still remember what I mentioned earlier?,大家还记得吗。
"When you see someone littering, just come up and shout out, ""Hey, pal, you dropped something.""",我前面说如果看到有人乱扔垃圾，你就上去大声吼一声：“哎，朋友，东西掉了。”
But why bother shouting?,为什么要大喊一声？
"Interestingly, you'll find all people nearby, not only the guy who just threw the litter, will turn around to see whether they have dropped their purse.",其实你会发现，这时候回头的，不止是刚才那个扔垃圾的人，所有人都诶，我钱包呢？
"When they find their purse in place, they will uniformly throw a gaze at the guy who just littered.",当他们发现钱包没有丢的时候，他们会齐刷刷地把眼光，都注视刚才那个扔垃圾的人。
This is the power of the crowd.,这就是群众的力量。
"When he comes the focus of people, the more people look at him, the more ashamed he will feel.",当所有的目光，集中在这个人身上的时候，目光越多，他越害臊。
"And the more quickly people look at him, the more quickly he'll pick up the litter.",目光越快，他捡得就越快。
"Now, let's consider another scenario.",好，我们现在换一个场景。
"When you're waiting at the traffic light and someone is about to run the red light, you could say, ""Hey, that guy with hat. Don't hurry. We can go together when the light turns green.""",假设现在，我在人行道上准备过马路，这时候呢，来了一个要穿马路的人，“哎，那个戴帽子的， 别着急，翻灯我们一起走。”
Why?,为什么呢？
"You have to shout ""the guy with hat"" because we have to give an accurate description of the guy's appearance.",我要喊出“哎，戴帽子的”，就是你要在第一时间，迅速把他体貌特征给描述出来。
But why?,这是为什么？
"Well, this allows people waiting to spot the redlight runner.",就让所有跟着你一起排队的人，马上找到谁是出头鸟。
"When he turns around to see all people are looking at him, he'll walk no further.",这时候他一回头看到所有人都看着他，他就不会往前走了。
"And those who are tempted to follow him will be deterred because they know if they take another step, I may call out ""That guy with glasses!""",而且，所有本来想跟他走的人，知道，如果我走了，也许我就喊“那个戴眼镜的！”
"So the first trick is what I call ""You're not alone"".",所以这就是第一招，叫做你不是一个人在战斗。
"The second trick of meddling is called ""He's not your enemy"".",第二招，叫他不是你敌人。
What does that mean?,什么意思？
Let's return to the case of picking up litter mentioned earlier.,再回到我们前面捡垃圾的这个案例。
"When you remind the guy, ""Hey, pal, you dropped something.""",当你提醒他的时候，“哎，朋友，东西掉了。”
You are not pushing him to the line of being immoral.,其实呢，这个时候你并没有把他推到了道德的另一端。
So what exactly is the relationship between you two?,你和他的关系是什么呢？
"You're a kind-hearted passer-by, reminding him of taking his own staff.",你是一个爱心路人，提醒他不要忘记东西。
"So likewise, imagine we're on the way to the subway.",所以同样的道理，假设这时候我们换一个场景，我们去坐地铁。
"Well, normally, I don't take the subway.",哦我平时不爱坐地铁。
But what I like about taking the subway is when someone stands on the left of the escalator.,但是我看到有人站在左边的时候，我特别爱坐地铁。
What would you do?,哎，这时候你怎么办？
"""Hey, pal, excuse me.""",“哎，朋友，不好意思，借过一下。”
"In this case, the guy is not the one who stands in your way but rather someone who makes room for you.",这时候，你跟挡住你去路的人之间的关系，他并不是挡住你去路的人，他是一个行你方便的路人。
"Actually, he is quite familiar with the etiquette of ""stand right, walk left"", and with a kindly reminder, he will actively follow the rule.",其实这个道理他完全懂，左行右立，你只要给他一个善意的提醒，他就会跟着你走。
"This is the so-called ""He's not your enemy"".",这是第二招，他不是你敌人。
"The last, and also the most interesting trick is called ""Do talk sense"".",这第三招最有意思，叫务必说人话。
What is it?,什么意思？
It is the principle of avoiding talking relentlessly when people litter.,就是当别人扔垃圾的时候，你不是唐僧，别学唐僧。
"Hey, do not litter.",哎呀，你不要乱扔垃圾啊。
What if your litter hit the kids?,万一扔到小朋友多不好呀？
"Even if you didn't throw the litter at the kids, it would be just as bad if the litter falls on the flowers or grass.",就算没有扔到小朋友，扔到花花草草也不好啊。
"In fact, those who litter are quite aware of this.",其实这些扔垃圾的人，道理他都懂。
And a gentle reminder will motivate them to pick up the litter.,你只要点他一下，他自然很自觉地就会把垃圾捡起来。
Let's reconsider the case of smoking.,那好，我们再回到前面也提到过的一个场景，抽烟。
"Imagine you're in a cosy, well-decorated restaurant.",假设你去了一个餐厅，非常环境优美。
And a young man takes out a cigarette and is about to light it.,这时候，有一个小伙子，拿起根香烟，准备点，很简单。
You could just walk to him.,你就走上前去。
"""Hey, pal, I'm pregnant.""",“哎，兄弟，我怀孕了。”
He wouldn't be so dumb as to ask why you as a man could be pregnant.,他不会问“你这老爷们怀什么孕啊。”
He will naturally put away the cigarette.,他自然就会把烟收起来。
What if he still refuses to pick up the litter or insists on running the red light or lighting the cigarette after you have done what I've told you?,如果我按照你讲的做了，他还是没有捡垃圾，他还是乱穿马路，他还是点起了香烟，你怎么办？
Does that mean our persuasion has failed to achieve its results?,那我请问大家，如果说他没有把垃圾捡起来，继续穿过马路，继续点起香烟，那我的劝导，是失败了吗？
Does anyone think it is a failure?,有认为是失败的吗？
"Ok, you are quite rational.",诶大家觉悟都很高。
"In fact, it is not just the rule-breaker that you are persuading.",实际上，你所真正劝导的，并不是那个违反行为准则的那个人而已。
I heard the following dialogues more than once in the street.,我不止一次在大街上，听到周围就有人在这样对话。
"""You see, do not litter in the future.""",“看到吗，以后你不要乱扔垃圾。”
"""You see, do not run the red light in the future.""",“看到吗，你不要乱穿马路。”
"""You see, this is a volunteer. You should follow his example when you grow up.""",“知道吗，这叫志愿者，你长大以后要向他学习。”
"To many moms, I have been a role model for their kids.",我成为很多妈妈们给孩子教育的一个榜样。
Your persuasion may help cultivate our future social leaders or prevent one child from a car accident.,也许你的一个劝导，也许就培养出了未来的我们的社会领袖，更或者是，你避免了一个孩子可能发生的车祸。
"So even if your interference does not work and the person you persuade does not act the way you expect him/her to, other people will still be delighted about your action, for this gives them hope.",所以你的这个行动，即使你所劝导的人，没有按照你所劝导的方向去行为，但是周围的所有人，他至少会为你的行动感到高兴，感到这个社会还有希望。
We often compare life as a journey.,我们经常把人生比作是个旅程。
"If one day, you and I are at the same bus station, waiting for the bus to take us to our next stop.",假如某一天，在座的各位，跟我在同一个车站，等一班载我们去下一程的班车。
And then here comes a bus.,这时候开来一辆班车。
The door opens.,打开门。
"We move forward to ask the driver, ""Where is the bus heading for?""",我们探头问司机：“请问这辆车开往哪里？”

"""Fickle World.""",“再下一站，世态炎凉。”
"""So where exactly are we heading for? What's the destination?""",“那么到底去哪里呢？终点站是在哪里？”
"""I have no idea, but we are heading for the darkness.""",“我不知道，我只知道向着黑暗开。”
Put up your hand if you want to take this bus.,愿意上这辆大巴的人请举手。
"Just like me, you won't get on the bus.",你们跟我一样，你们不会坐上这辆大巴。
And then here comes another bus.,这时候又来了第二辆大巴。
The door opens.,打开门。
"The driver invites us to get on the bus, smiling, but we want to know its destination, ""Hi, mister, where is the bus heading for?""",司机微笑地请你上车，我们要问问清楚，“诶，司机大哥，你这辆车开往哪里？”
"""Ah, the next stop is Meddling.""",“啊，我们下一站是多管闲事站。”
"""And the next?""",“那么再下一站呢？”
"""You're Not Alone.""",“再下一站是众人拾柴站。”
"""And the next?""",“那再下一站？”
"""Sparks of Fire.""",“再下一站是星星之火站。”
"""And what's the destination?""",“那么请问终点站是哪里？”
"""Well, I have no idea actually, but we are heading for the sunshine.""",“嘶其实我也不是很清楚，我只知道我向着阳光而开。”
"My friends, put up your hand if you want to take this bus.",在座的各位，愿意上这辆大巴的人请举手。
Welcome!,欢迎大家！

"On the other hand, when they get married and want to start a family, they have to seek medical care because of infertility.",另一方面是成年以后步入了婚姻家庭，想要拥有自己的孩子但是不孕而痛苦求医。
"While paying high medical expenses, they must endure the torments of the past and the future.",在付出高昂医药费的同时还要忍受身心的煎熬，精神的折磨。
Such a strange phenomenon deserves reflection from each of us.,这样一种奇怪的现象值得我们每一个人思考。
"I also want to take advantage of TnDao to tell more young boys and girls that premature sexual life, first of all, is harmful. Of course, I also hope that there will be more opportunities for face-to-face communication like today.",我也想借助听道这个讲坛，当然我也希望今后有更多像今天这样面对面交流的机会，来告诉更多的年轻的男孩子女孩子们，首先，过早的性生活是有百害而无一利的。
"Secondly, I was young once, so I can relate that sometimes it’s not easy to control oneself if the two really love each other.",其次，我也年轻过，当然我也能理解，如果真是两情相悦，情到深处难以自控的时候。
"However, I strongly recommend that some necessary proper protective measures be taken.",我觉得一定要采取一些必要的正确的保护措施。
What are proper protective measures?,那么什么是正确的保护措施呢？
Let me share some of my own views.,我谈几点个人的看法。
"Condom is a very good tool for contraception, besides preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, but it must be used during the whole intercourse.",避孕套condom是一个非常好的工具避孕方法，它既可以避孕，也可以防止性病的传播，但是呢一定要全程使用。
"Just several days ago, I chatted about the topic with a few of my friends.",前两天我跟我几个朋友聊天的时候谈到这个话题。
I joked that in a few years when my son who is currently a pre-primary pupil grows bigger.,我跟他们开玩笑说，再过几年等我儿子长大啦，因为他现在才读预备班还太小了一点。
"I would tell him that condoms must be used during the whole process of all premarital sex intercourse, and it is best to have a check together afterwards.",我说再过几年等我儿子长大啦，我一定会告诫他，婚前的性生活一定要全程使用避孕套，而且最好是在完事的时候大家再共同检查验证一下。
It is also a protective measure for girls.,这样做对女孩儿也是一种保护措施。
"This is because some viruses like HPV, i.e., human papilloma virus, can be carried by men without getting sick; however, persistent HPV infection can cause precancerous lesions of female’s cervix, which can finally develop into cervical cancer.",因为有一些病毒像HPV病毒，也就是人乳头瘤状病毒，它在男性可以带病毒但不患病；但是持续的HPV感染对女性来说，可以造成你宫颈的癌前病变，发展到最后就是宫颈癌。
"Patients often ask me, ""Dr. Tang, why did I still get pregnant this month after I have taken the plan-B?""",经常会有病人问我说：“唐医生，为什么我这个月吃了紧急避孕药我还是怀孕了呢？”
"I ask her: ""How did you take your pills?""",我跟她说：“你怎么吃的？”
"""I took one on the 5th and another one on the 13th, probably one again on the 18th or 19th, and maybe another one the other day in the last third of this month,” she answers.",她说：“我五号吃了一次，十三号吃了一次，大概是十八九号呃又吃了一次，好像前两天二十几号还吃了一次。”
"""Miss, are those sugar pills?” I ask, “So you always take one when you feel like eating.”",我跟她说：“小姐，那是糖丸儿吗？你想起来噔吃一粒，想起来噔吃一粒。”
"Why is it ""a plan-B""?",什么叫紧急？
Because it is the last ditch in case of an emergency.,那是在紧急情况下迫不得已而为之的。
"The emergency contraceptive is used during the first half of the menstrual cycle, which only has 85 percent of the contraceptive effect, not 100 percent, and it will have no effect in the second half of the menstrual cycle after ovulation.",因为紧急避孕药在月经的前半周期使用，它只有百分之八十五的避孕的功效，不是百分之百，如果排卵以后在月经的后半期它是没有作用的。
"At last, I’d like to talk about short-acting oral contraceptives.",最后我再谈一下短效的口服避孕药。
"Many young women are scared of contraceptives, because they feel that contraceptives would cause weight gain, breast pain or prolonged menstrual period.",很多年轻的女性谈到避孕药以后，谈虎色变，觉得那样发胖，乳房胀痛，月经滴滴答答等等副作用。
"In fact, the short-acting oral contraceptives that are available on the market today are very safe.",其实现在市场上市面上能买到的那种短效口服避孕药，都是非常安全的。
I mean those contraceptives that are taken one each day for consecutive 21 days.,就是那种二十一天一天吃一粒的那个短效口服避孕药都是非常安全的。
"After years of improvement in the process, the estrogen in the pills is reduced, so is the risk, and the progestational hormone contained is closer to the natural one.",因为经过多年的工艺的改进，它里面的雌激素的成分降低了，所以它减低了风险，它里面的孕激素的成分更加接近天然的孕激素。
"Therefore, such side effects as water-sodium retention, obesity, liver damage and prolonged menstrual period are alleviated.",所以由此减轻了水钠储留、发胖还有这个肝功能损害，月经滴滴答答等副作用。
"Moreover, short-acting oral contraceptives can not only prevent contraception, but also are conducive to protecting women's ovarian function, treating dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, and adjusting menstrual cycle.",而且短效口服避孕药不仅可以避孕，对保护女性的卵巢功能，对治疗痛经、子宫内膜异位症、调整月经周期等等都是有好处的。
"However, I’d like to stress that contraceptives must be used under the guidance of a doctor.",但是强调一点，一定都要在医生的指导下使用。
"In the end, I’d like to talk about Dr. Albert Schweitzer who is known as the greatest doctor of the last century.",最后我再给大家介绍一位被人们称之为上个世纪最伟大的医生史怀哲医生。
Everyone in China knows Bethune but Schweitzer.,在中国大家都知道白求恩不知道史怀哲。
"In the West, however, Dr. Schweitzer is almost known to every household.",但是在西方他几乎是家喻户晓。
He is a German and a friend of Einstein.,他是德国人，是爱因斯坦的挚友。
"Einstein once said: ""I have almost never met anyone like Schweitzer who is an ideal phantom of love and beauty.""",爱因斯坦说：“像史怀哲这样理想的集爱和对美的渴望于一身的人，我几乎还没有发现过。”
"He was originally a pastor, and received a doctorate in both theology and and philosophy at the age of 25.",他本来是个牧师，二十五岁的时候呢就获得了神学博士和哲学博士。
"When he was 30, he was already a professor of philosophy and a famous pipe organ player.",三十岁的时候呢，他已经是哲学教授，而且还是著名的管风琴的演奏家。
"Being not only a player but also a repairman of the instrument, he wrote down a lot of books on this subject.",他不仅会弹管风琴而且还会修，写了不少这方面的书籍。
"But just at thirty, he was inspired by God and decided to study medicine.",但是在他三十岁的时候，他受到神的感召，他立志要学医。
We all started studying medicine at the age of 18 while he began to study medicine at the age of 30.,我们都是十八岁开始学医的，他以三十岁的高龄开始学医。
"At the age of 38, he got a doctor‘s degree of medicine in Germany, then he and his wife chose to work in the jungles in Africa from then on.",三十八岁在德国的时候，获得了医学博士，从此他带着夫人一头扎进了非洲丛林。
So he was called a jungle doctor and an African saint.,所以他被人们称之为丛林医生和非洲圣人。
"In Africa, he ran a free clinic to treat patients.",在非洲他免费开办诊所为人免费看病。
"Not only the medical treatment was free of charge, but all food and housing during hospitalization were for free.",不仅看病是免费的，住院期间的所有的吃住都是免费的。
He had been working in Africa until the age of 90 and was buried nearby the clinic in the African jungle.,他一直在非洲工作到九十岁，他去世葬在了非洲丛林那个诊所旁。
"His behavior changed the local generation and even generations in Africa because he not only gave people medical treatment, but also taught them to eat cooked food, how to drink healthy water, how to prevent some common infectious diseases and sunburn in the local area.",他的行为改变了非洲当地一代甚至几代人，因为他不仅给人看病，而且还教会人们要吃煮熟了的食物，如何来饮用健康卫生的水，怎么样来预防当地一些常见的传染病和日晒病。
"And for the sake of patients, especially the nutrition of the inpatients, he would grow vegetables and breed farmed animals.",而且为了病人，加强住院病人的营养，他会去种菜，他会去养殖动物。
"So without any dispute, when he was 78 years old in 1953, he won the Nobel Peace Prize, and all the bonuses were used to establish hospitals.",所以在1953年他七十八岁的时候他毫无争议地获得了诺贝尔和平奖，所有的奖金仍然被他拿来创建医院。
"Schweitzer is a man with diverse talents, but his life's achievements are derived from the power of faith and broad love.",史怀哲身上是一个聚集着多样天分的人，然而他一生的成就还是来源于信仰的力量和博大的爱心。
"This is also what contemporary people, especially our medical practitioners, should learn.",这也是我们当代人特别是我们医务工作者应该学习的地方。
"I have been preparing for tonight’s speech for a period of time, including this afternoon, and I arrived here early without arranging any surgery and other things.",这段时间我一直在准备今天晚上的演讲，包括今天下午，我也没有安排手术和其他的事情，早早地赶到了这里。
"Maybe I will do one less surgery or see fewer patients because of the speech, but if my speech tonight can inspire or help your in your future life in any way, or you can become aware that we must be responsible for each other to protect the common love between us.",也许我因此而少做一台手术或者少看了几个病人，但是如果我今晚的演讲对在座的听众朋友今后的人生或者生活能够有一点点的启示或者帮助，能够让大家有一种意识，我们要对彼此负责，对共同的爱撑起一把保护伞。
"I will be greatly encouraged. For me who has overcome my inner fear and nervousness to finally stand on the stage of TnDao, this will be my biggest gain tonight!",那么对于克服了内心恐惧紧张情绪，而终于站上听道讲坛上的我来说，将是一个极大的鼓励，也是我今晚最大的收获！
Thank you all!,谢谢大家！
I Had a Dream Where You Dreamed of Me.,《我梦见你梦见了我》。
"The title is quite a mouthful. Or we can make it even twistier, Liu Mengmei had a dream where Du Liniang Dreamed of Liu Mengmei.",这个题目有点拗口，或者可以叫柳梦梅梦见了杜丽娘梦见了柳梦梅。
My inspiration of the title comes from an opera I am too familiar with.,我之所以想用这样一个题目，是因为这是一出我再熟悉不过的剧目。
"As is well known, in The Peony Pavilion by Tang Xianzu, a great writer of the Ming Dynasty, Du Liniang has an unusual dream.",明代的大文豪汤显祖先生写的《牡丹亭》当中，杜丽娘做了一个非同寻常的梦，大家都知道。
"However, I insist that the dream does not only belong to her.",但是，我却很固执地认为这不仅仅是属于杜丽娘的梦。
"During the past twenty years of opera training, every time I played in it, Liu Mengmei was the first character to appear on stage, saying that he had a dream where a girl told him they were meant to be together.",学这个戏二十多年，诶，我每次上台的时候其实是柳梦梅先上场， 他说我做了一个梦，我梦见一个女孩子在梦里面跟我说，我们有姻缘之分。
It was not untill the tenth act did Du Liniang come out.,戏演到第十出的时候杜丽娘才出来。
She also had a dream in which Liu Mengmei told her they were destined for each other.,做了一个梦，柳梦梅出现在她的梦当中说我们两个有姻缘之分。
I myself found this quite fascinating.,啧我觉得非常非常地有趣。
Liu Mengmei dreams Du Liniang dreams of him.,其实是柳梦梅梦见杜丽娘梦见了柳梦梅。
They actually wander into each other's dream.,两个人相互进入到各自的梦当中去。
Their dreams are so intertwined and romantic that make me wonder how complicated a dream could be.,但是这个梦如此的纠缠不清，如此的浪漫，啧哎呀我想，梦居然具有这么广阔的空间。
"It is not the dream itself that matters, though.",但是其实重要的不仅仅是梦本身。
"If Du Liniang does not pursue the dream, even regardless of her life,  there would not be such a touching story in which for love the living can die and the dead can be revived.",在有这个梦以后，杜丽娘决定要去寻梦，甚至可以放下她的生命去寻梦，才有了这样一个生者可以死，死者可以生的，一个《牡丹亭》的伟大的爱情故事。
"So I believe, what really matters is whether you pursue your dream.",所以我觉得，梦之后最重要的，是你对这个梦的自我的选择是什么。
"As a masterpiece, Peony Pavilion has not only given Du a dream and offered us space to perform, but also taught us an attitude towards life.",后来我也发现，《牡丹亭》这样伟大的巨著，四百多年来到今天，不仅仅给了杜丽娘一个梦，给了我们一个表演的空间，更给了我们一种人生的态度。
"From my perspective, what matters most is not what I have dreamed of, but what I would do if I had a dream.",对于我的梦来讲，最重要的不是我梦见什么，而是对于这样的梦我的选择是什么。
I started to learn opera since I was little.,从很小的时候开始。
"I spent eight years laying groundwork for my dream, and that made all my performance on the stage.",呃，我差不多用了八年的时间，坐科八年，来铸就一个我做梦的一个基础，那就是，我所有演戏的那一些舞台上的唱面坐打翻，舞台上的点点滴滴 。

How hard?,多少痛苦？
You may go watch the movie Farewell My Concubine by Director Chen Kaige.,大家可以去看陈凯歌先生的《霸王别姬》这个电影，
"Although it is set in the dark days, the experience of us actors is the same.",虽然那是万恶的旧社会，但是其实作为一个学戏的演员来讲，我们所经历的所有的过程都一样。
"But because of the painful experience, I have the chance to dream.",但是正是因为有了这一些积累，才让我有做梦的机会。
I started to dream after years of training.,而从我寻梦开始的起点来讲。
"On October 9, 2002, I got the opportunity to perform, with Japanese Kabuki master Ichikawa Emiya, the story of a Japanese Duliniang and a Chinese Liu Mengmei dreaming  together.",那是完成了很多年学习以后，2002年的10月9号，我跟日本歌舞伎的大师市川笑也先生，一起演了一个日本的杜丽娘和中国的柳梦梅在一起做梦的故事。

"He said he was confident that he can act well because, as he put it, China was exactly where they learnt these skills from.",嗯，市川笑也先生说我一定可以演得很好，是因为，我们很多东西是从你们那里传来的。
"His words enlightened me. Indeed, when you get too familiar with something, you will neglect it.",我才发现原来一个东西一个梦想在你身边你太熟悉的时候，你会忽略它。
"So when we chase your dream, we will recollect what we have left behind, thus learning to respect and restoring our faith in the future.",所以当我们去寻找一个梦想的时候，会让我们发现过去，那份过去是让我们学会尊重，让我们有更多的信心去朝前走得更远。
That was also why I felt so full of strength at the beginning of my pursuit of dream.,所以当这个寻梦之旅开始的时候，我觉得，哦原来梦想可以给我这么大的一个力量。
What the pursuit of dream gives me even more is the ability to change the present.,寻梦其实也可以给我更多的一种力量是：改变现在。
In 2008 I was very honored to be invited by Mr. Tan Dun to act a special character named Rustichello in his opera Marco Polo.,在2008年的时候非常有幸，谭盾先生请我去做他的歌剧《马可波罗》当中一个很特别的一个角色，那这个角色名字叫做Rustichello。

"On the first day, when Mr. Tan introduced me to others, he said that Zhang Jun was an inheritor of Kunqu, an art with 600 years of history, and he had learnt a lot of traditional Kunqu plays including bla, bla, bla, which are so distinctive.",而那天我们一起排练的时候谭盾介绍大家认识，介绍到我的时候就说张军是中国昆曲的六百年历史的这样的一个艺术的传承者，他学了很多昆曲的传统的戏，有哪些哪些哪些，昆曲是多么的与众不同。

"He replied, ""In fact everyone of us is Marco Polo. It is openness.",他是这样说的，他说：“其实我们每个人都是马可波罗。
"The play is called Marco Polo, but actually everyone of us is Marco Polo, in that we all want to disseminate to the western world the eastern arts, cultures and spirits we hold dear.",这出戏叫麦《马可波罗》，但是我们每个人都是马可波罗，我们都想把身边我们觉得美好的东方的艺术、文化、精神，可以传播出去，传播到西方的朋友去身身边去。

"You need an open mind to embrace others' ideas, learn from others and share with others.",它叫open，它叫开放；你需要有一颗开放的心，你愿意去拥抱别人，你愿意向别人学习，愿意跟别人一起来互动来分享。”

"In thinking deeply about it, I realized that this was a strength dream pursuing could bring us, a strength that broadened our mind so as to change everything at the present.",那我想，原来寻梦给我们的力量，是让我们可以有这样的胸怀去改变所有的一切，改变现在。
This is just like the first line of the opera.,就像这一出戏的第一句话第一句台词。
"Interestingly,it's an opera with an English libretto and Kunqu-style music, all by Tan Dun. The first line goes like this,  ""As the book of time space opens, there is music suggesting the Peking Opera. """,非常有意思，整个表演都是谭盾设计的昆曲加英文，这句台词叫As the book of time space opens，there is music suggesting the Peking Opera。
"Peking Opera represents not only itself, but also Kunqu Opera, or a voice from China.",Peking Opera不仅仅代表京剧，我觉得也代表昆曲，更代表了一种中国的声音。
We can change the present and enrich our voices.,我们可以改变现在，让自己拥有更多中国的声音。

I reckon this kind of music to be highly penetrating.,我想这样的音乐，是非常非常，具有穿透力。
"It reminds me back to the Ming Dynasty, when Du Liniang was dreaming her dreams, when she was singing about the blooms and grass, thinking to live or to die, there was definitly no electricity.",我想在明代的时候，杜丽娘在做梦的时候，她在唱那一些花花草草、生生死死的时候，一定没有电。
But the electric means today allow us to trace back to where our dreams started and recover our original aspiration.,那我们今天拥有这些电的手段，恰恰其实是让我们回到我们梦想最最开始的地方，让我们一起回到我们曾经做梦的那个源头在哪里。
The name of this music is Jiang Er Shui–All of a Sudden My Heart is Drawn.,这段唱腔叫《江儿水·偶然间心似缱》。
"Those ways of worship a thousand years ago, those implicit love stories, the most romantic dream Du Liniang had ever dreamed,  remind me that when we make a choice about our dreams, and when we have faith in our inner voices, we can certainly create a completely different future.",那些一千多年前的祭菩方式，那些委婉的爱情故事，那个杜丽娘曾经做过的那个最最最最浪漫悠远的梦，让我们知道，我们去选择自己梦想的时候，当我们去相信自己心灵的声音的时候，我们一定可以创造一种全新的未来。
"Well, I think listening is sometimes a pleasure.",嗯，我觉我觉得呃听讲有的时候呃是一一种享受。
Why didn’t I listen when I was a child?,我为什么小时候不愿听讲呢？
I thought that people around me were always trying to force me to learn.,因为我觉得，我周围的人老要强迫我要明白这明白那。

I will prove it with a piece of music.,而下一首曲子，我要用音乐来鉴证。
"It’s chamber music, and it’s for close appreciation.",因为这个叫室内乐，就是近距离的。
"We will perform unplugged, because I never believe in technology.",而且我们演奏的时候大家会因为我人生坚信技术不靠谱，所以我们会没有电。
"I believe that, although we are messing around the internet, information or even some cosmic things, one day when people on this blue planet forget about electricity, music will still be there and these instruments will still make sound.",我坚信有一天，别说咱们现在弄什么网络啦，弄什么信息，什么宇宙，有一天这个蓝色星球上的人，连发电都忘了的时候，我们这曲子还能响，这琴还能出声儿。
That is art.,这个东西叫艺术。
"We’re going to play a well-known piece composed by Johann Pachelbel, the teacher of the great European musician Bach.",现在我们将为大家演奏三百年前，呃一个伟大的，欧洲的作曲家音乐家，他叫巴赫，不是他，他的老师，叫帕哈贝尔的一首其实大家非常熟悉的乐曲。

This year marks the bicentenary of Wagner’s birth.,瓦格纳是呃两百，今年是瓦格纳诞辰两百周年。
"This is not the right place to talk about music, and I am not the right person to talk about it.",说音乐今天不是地方儿，我也不配、不称。
"But when you boys interested in war history, and, of course, girls who are interested, watch documentaries about Nazi Germany during World War II, when you see the military parades, Nazi rallies or bombers dropping bombs inhumanely, you may notice that there is music on the background.",但是关心战争史的男孩子们，当然今天也有关心战争史的女孩子们，大家比如看到了这个第二世界大战的时候，纳粹德国的这个阅兵式，凯旋，它的这个纳粹的这个什么集会，包括轰炸机在在灭绝人性地在投炸弹的时候，那个宣传片儿里还有音乐。
Most of the music was written by Wagner.,这个宣传片儿的背景音乐大多都是出自瓦格纳之手， 就这人儿。
I will run through it as quick as possible.,所以这个音乐呢，我我尽量地跳跃。
Please bear with me for a while.,请大家一定听讲，尽尽可能。

"Then, what is the relationship between clothing and people, or society as a whole?",那么服饰和人和社会的关系，究竟体现在哪些方面呢？
Let's start with the status of clothing in Chinese history.,那么我们就先从服饰在中国历史上的地位开始说起。
The rudiment of China's ritual costume system was first established in the Shang Dynasty in the 16th century B.C.,公元前十六世纪在我们商朝，已经建立了冠服制度的雏形。
"In the 11th century B.C., the Western Zhou Dynasty replaced the Shang Dynasty.",到了公元前十一世纪，西周取代了商。
Everybody has heard of the Ritual of Zhou.,周礼，我们大家都听说过。
The Ritual of Zhou had developed a very sophisticated and systematic ritual costume system.,在周礼里面已经制定了非常完善和系统的冠服礼制。
"In the Zhou Dynasty, there was even an official position called Si Fu, which was responsible for the dress etiquette of emperors and nobles.",在周朝甚至还有一个官职叫做司服，它专门负责帝王和贵族的衣着礼仪。
"Since then, successive dynasties all had precise and strict provisions on ritual costume dressing code.",从此之后我们的历朝历代，对冠服制度都有着极为严谨和严格的规定。
"As we can see in this picture, the crown is on the left and the dress on the right.",我们看到这张图片上，左边是冠，右边是服。
"In the upper right corner of this crown, you can see the appreciation seal of Emperor Qianlong.",在这个冠的右上角你们可以看到乾隆御览之宝。
"Yes, this is the Imperial Ritual Vessels Diagram.",没错，这就皇朝礼器图示。
The Imperial Ritual Vessels Diagram serves as an extremely important sample for imperial ritual vessels.,皇朝礼器图示作为一个帝国极为重要的礼器范本。
It was taken as a loot to the overseas market due to the invasion of the Eight-Power Allied Forces at end of the Qing Dynasty.,它在清末，八国联军的时候，失散到了海外。
"Let's look at the next picture, which is also from the Imperial Ritual Vessels Diagram.",我们再看下一张图片，这也是皇朝礼器图式上的图片。
"The bronze ware on the left is called Gui, while the ritual vessels on the right is Bian Dou, which was made of bamboo.",左边这是一个青铜器，叫簋，右边是一个礼器，叫做笾豆，竹制的。
"Thus it can be seen that up until the Qing Dynasty, the crown, dress, and  bronze wares and ritual vessels that were used in temple sacrifice activities, were of equal social and political importance.",由此可见，直到清朝，我们的冠、服和祭祀宗庙的青铜器礼器，都有着同等重要的社会政治地位。
"In the Qing Dynasty, the color yellow was the exlusive color for the emperor.",在清朝，明黄色是帝王的御用色。
"The ornamentation of a golden dragon with five claws must be bestowed upon the government officials by the emperor, and only officers from the first to the fifth grade were allowed to use the ornamentation of a golden dragon with five claws, bestowed by the emperor.",而五爪金龙的纹饰必须由帝王的恩赐，下面的臣子才可以使用，而且必须是一品到五品的品级，才可以用五爪金龙，由皇帝御赐可以使用五爪金龙。
It is thus clear that hierarchy of status based on costumes has always been an important part of the political and cultural life of our country from the slave society to the feudal society.,可见以服制来划分身份等级制度，一直以来，从奴隶社会到封建社会，都是非常作为我们国家的政治文化生活的一个重要构成。

I guess this is also a kind of narcissism.,这也算一种自恋。
"However, after knowing it, I will automatically think about how to raise the ratings higher.",但是看完以后，以后就会自觉不自觉地动脑筋，怎么让收视率提得高一点。
"For example, once after a show, I looked at the audience rating by minute and found that, out of the ten points where the viewership exceeded 3% I had seven.",比如有一次我看到，一档节目完了之后，我拿到了那个分钟收视率，其中有十个点上收视率超过了3%，发现自己里面占了七个。
This was quite fulfilling.,很有成就感。
"However, during such a process, as I went on, I felt wrong.",但是在这样一个过程中间，走着走着就发现不对了。
My ideas and opinions were getting more and more predictable.,我的讲话、观点被磨得越来越圆了。
I was appealing to the audience.,我要去让更多的人接受我。
"However, looking back at what I said, I felt sorry for myself.",但是再回过头来看看，自己的那个观点好像越来越对不起自己了。
"In fact, high ratings are easy to get.",其实收视率是很简单的事情。
We all know that suppose there is a human intelligence pyramid; there are fewer with a higher IQ and more with lower IQ.,我们都知道人类的智商是金字塔，越是智商高的人越少，智商低的人越多。
"Therefore, when you are pursuing the ratings, you will unconsciously win audience from the lower layer.",所以当你一个人在追求收视率的时候，你就会自觉不自觉地向下面去打捞你的听众。
"When your ratings are large enough, it means that now you have more audience from the bottom of the pyramid, where there are many cobblers.",而等到你收视率足够多的时候，那就意味着最底层的都被你给打捞上来了，这里边就是有大量的臭皮匠。
"This suggest that the idea of “three cobblers outwitting a master mind"" is unreliable.",那么这样一种现象告诉我们，“三个臭皮匠，顶个诸葛亮”其实是靠不住的。
"Therefore, if we expect to bring together a crowd of people with general intelligence to come up with a genius idea, we are likely to be disappointed.",所以我们如果寄希望于把好多智商一般的人聚集到一起来，想从里面获得高大上的点子很难。
"Therefore, I remember being told by my mother as a child that “better work for a wise man than advise a fool.""",所以我记得我小时候母亲就同我说的过“宁可给聪明人提包，也不要给笨蛋出主意。”
What she means is that we will learn much from working for a smart person and come to think in a smarter way.,她的意思就是说给聪明人提包，你也能学到一些东西，变得越来越聪明。
"That is what we call ""learn from those who do better."" in Chinese.",用中国话来说就学着点。
"However, after you give advice to a slow-witted person, on the one hand, he may fail to execute it rightly.",但是给笨人出主意之后，一个他做不好。
"On the other hand, you may have to accommodate to him and you may come to think as he does.",另外一个你要迁就他，也会变得越来越愚蠢。
"And the other way round, if no three cobblers can ever outperform a mastermind, then why do we have such a saying?",但是我们反过来说，如果真的是三个臭皮匠顶不了一个诸葛亮的话，那我们何以又会出现这样的说法呢？
"So, as I see it, the right question to ask is that under what conditions can the cobbler outwit a master mind?",所以我想这里边的问题，可能在于我们是不是该换个角度，什么样的条件下臭皮匠能够顶诸葛亮呢。
I was once asked a question many years ago.,记得好多年前有人问过我一个问题。
At that time the planned economy has just been replaced by the market economy and the former state-owned vegetable market replaced by today’s farmer markets.,那是计划经济刚刚转到市市场经济，同以前国有的菜市场变革为今天的农贸市场的时候。
"One elder asked, ""In the past, before we open the market every day, we received the order from higher authorities of what to sell and how to price""",有一个长者就问过我一句话，他说：“过去我们菜市场，每天开秤的时候，都有上面一级一级下达今天什么菜，卖什么价格的命令。”
"He said, ""Now on the farmer markets, every trader makes his own decision, but why their pricing are still the same? Do they meet together before the market opens and set out a pricing otherwise why does everyone sell at the same price?""",他说：“现在到了农贸市场，每个人都是独立自主了，怎么最后价格还是一样的。农贸市场的小贩是不是每天开秤之前，也要开一个小组会，大家一起讨论出一个统一的价格，否则怎么会都卖成一个模样了呢？”
Is this idea understandable?,这个想法正常吗？
It is understandable.,很正常。
Because many of us find it difficult to switch from one mode to another.,因为从一种模式到另外一种模式，这个过渡好多的人一时转不过来。
What's more important is that there is actually one thing hidden in his mind.,更重要的是在他的脑子里面其实隐含了一样东西。
He thinks that the most reasonable way in our society often comes from self-consciousness.,就说我们这个社会中间最合理的办法，往往是要出自于一个自觉的意识。
"So today, when we talk about whether three “cobblers” can outwit a “master mind”, it does not mean that the decision negotiated by the three would be better than that of the “master mind”.",所以我们今天讲三个臭皮匠能不能顶一个诸葛亮，不是三个臭皮匠商量好了我们要去战胜一个诸葛亮。
"What we mean is that if each of us makes our own decisions and take action accordingly, we can do something that is impossible for a “master mind” alone.",而是我们每个人按照自己的方法做出我们的决策和行动，最后达到的那个效果却是任何一个诸葛亮都做不到的。
So let us look back and think about why China has developed so fast in the past 30 years?,所以我们回过头来想想，三十多年中中国为什么变得那么快？
It is an easy question.,很简单。
"It is because we have given the decision of pricing back to the hands of every ""cobbler"" from the single hand of the ""master mind"".",就是因为我们把过去由某一个人决定的价格交给了由许许多多臭皮匠，自己来决定价格。
"This price is far more reasonable and works better in resource allocation than a price set by a ""master mind"".",而这个价格的合理性，对于我们资源配置起的作用远远要比任何一个诸葛亮的定价更加合理。
How to decide the next mechanism of pricing for China?,中国再往后这样一个价格发现的机制在哪里？
"The price on our mind is no longer the price of products on the farmer markets, but the price of something that is of greatest significance today, our creation and invention.",我们讲的价格不再是农贸市场上的价格，而是讲我们今天最最重要的一样价格，就是我们的创造和发明。
We know that many people think that it took the West countries two or three hundred years to achieve what China has achieved in the past 30 years.,我们知道有许多人认为中国三十多年中发展的计划，走了西方两三百年的道路。
"Naturally, we feel so proud.",所以我们很自豪。
"Under this circumstance of excitement, a very sensible voice stood out.",在这种亢奋的情景中，我听到了一个非常理智的声音。
"It said: ""It is easy to answer why it only took China 20 or 30 years to achieve what the Western countries have achieved in 2 or 3 hundred years. Because when the West Countries were forging ahead, they were opening up a new path so they traveled slowly. But China is moving forward on the road that has been forged by the forerunners, so it was able to go faster.""",他说：“中国之所以在二三十年中走了西方两三百年的路，很简单，因为西方在往前走的时候，它是一边开路往前走的，这个速度自然就慢；而中国是在别人开好的路上往前走的，所以这个速度自然就要比别人快得多。”
So where are we today?,那么今天到了什么时候呢？
Those who have been forging the new path in front of us are continuing their work.,到了别人路开的，还在继续开。
"However, we are not welcomed to follow them.",但是留给我们的路已经不多了。
We are nearly reaching our end.,我们已经走到这条路的尽头了。
Now it is time we forge a new path along with others rather than take a ready-made road.,下面就需要我们跟着别人一起开路而不能再走别人开好的现成的路了。
"In the past when we talk about ""learning"", we are actually talking about following suit.",这也就是我们过去讲学习、学习，学习就是在走别人走过的路。
Today we find that there is less and less to learn from; there is less and less others are willing to share with us; it is becoming harder and harder to learn through technology acquisition.,今天我们发现可以学习的东西越来越少，别人愿意让我们学的东西越来越少，我们可以通过买技术消化提升的东西越来越少。
"When we traverse further down the road, how to decide the next ""market price""?",需要我们往前再走一步的时候，我们这个市场价格在哪里？
"Can we find a way to enable more people to take part in and act together to generate the effect that ""1.3 billion cobblers with their wits combined exceed that of ZHUGE Liang, the mastermind"".",我们能不能继续让更多的人用他的思考，用他的行动，最后产生出一个十三亿个臭皮匠顶上任何一个诸葛亮的效果。
"What we need today is not a master mind who decides for us what to create, what to think about and what to do.",今天需要的不是任何一个英明的人，他在决定着我们能够创造什么，能够思考什么，能够行动什么。
What we need is an environment in which all of us can contribute our wisdom and take ac act so we make something extraordinary happen.,而是需要有一个场景，在这个场景里面我们所有人的思考，所有人的行动，最后得出一个意想不到的结果。
Thank you all.,谢谢大家。
Hello everyone!,呃大家好！
"My topic today is optimism, and I'll primarily answer two questions.",今天我要讲一下这个乐观，我大概是讲两个问题。
"First, why is being optimistic a responsibility? ",一个是为什么乐观是责任，
What are the reasons behind?,呃有什么理由呃我们去呃承担这样一个责任。
"Second, how can we make ourselves optimistic? ",第二问题呢，我们怎么才能乐观，
How can we assume such a responsibility?,用什么样的方法我们才能去承担这样一个责任。
"As for the first question, my opinion is that optimism as a responsibility comes from our judgment about our current and future situations.",我想讲的作为责任的这个乐观，它是对于我们自身的现状和未来的这个呃判断。
"A judgment must be justified by reasons, so must the optimism as a responsibility. ",要判断就要有理由，所以作为责任的这个乐观它是需要理由的，
But do we have reasons to be optimistic?,但是我们有理由乐观吗？
"Young people may argue that they are being pressured by the exorbitant house prices, low incomes, fierce competition for school, and moreover, the difficulties in finding a job.",年轻人会说房价那么高，收入那么低，求学那么难，工作，找工作更难。
"The elder may cite the environmental pollution, corruption of officials, vulgarity of culture and fickle society when they claim that optimism is impossible.",年长者会说环境那么污染，呃官员那么腐败，啊文化那么这个低俗，人心那么浮躁，我们有理由乐观吗？
"People may say, ok, I admit optimism is a responsibility, and I never think about shirking it. ",有朋友说呃就算乐观是一种责任，而且我也不想推卸这种责任，
"But the problem is, I just can't feel optimistic. ",那么你告诉我我现在乐观不起来，
Is there any method to cheer me up?  ,你有没有办法让我乐观，
"Indeed, there are so many things to thwart our optimism. ",因为确实我们可以看到很多让我们乐观不起来的理由，
But can we find an approach to being more light-hearted?,我们有什么办法这个让自己这个乐观一点。
"The first advice I will give is that, always remember that ""Things don't always turn out the way we want, but what you dwell upon you become"".",我想说的第一条乐观的智慧就是：成事在天，成人在己。
"Living in this world, we have to answer three questions: what can we gain? What must we do? And who do we want to be?",我们生活在世界上无非是回答三个问题：啊有什么东西，做哪类事情，成何种人格。
"The morality cultivation would place ""what to do"" first.",从道德的角度来讲，首先碰到的问题是做什么事情。
"But in actual life, we tend to identify what to do as what to gain.",但是在实际生活当中我们往往会把做什么样事情的问题转化成为有什么东西的问题。
"For example, if someone cheats in academic research, or evades taxation in business, his major concern will be whether he will be caught and punished, and what penalties he will face.",我科研作弊，哎我这个经商逃税，会不会被人发现？会不会受罚？会受什么样的这个惩罚？
"If an official is refusing bribes and doing a good job in enforcing laws, what he considers most might be whether his performance will impress the public or his superiors, and whether there will be a possible promotion.",我这个为官清廉、我执法严明，啊群众是不是理解？啊领导是不是呃赏识？组织上会不会因此而给我重用等等。
"You see, all of them identify what to do as what to gain.",你看，都是把应当做什么样事情的这个问题变成了我们会得到什么、会拥有什么的这样的问题。
"The thing is, when such confusion occurs, something fundamental is missing: who do we want to be?",但是重要的是，当我们把做什么的问题变成有什么的这样问题的时候，我们可能忘记了一个最根本的问题，那就是我们要成为一个什么样人的这个问题。
We might do this or that and get away with it. ,我们做这件事或者那件事，很可能旁人全无所知；
But there is an omnipresent judge: ourselves. ,但是有一个人他对此事一目了然的，就是这件事或者那件事的你自己。
Sometimes the good or evil may not get their due requitals. ,我们做好事或者做坏事，很可能并不因此而得到善报或者得到恶报，
"But if you want to be good, you can always preserve your integrity against all odds. ",如果你有心向善，啊出污泥也可以不染；
"If you just pamper little evils, you may sink into degeneration whatever admonitions you receive.",如果你无意戒恶，近朱者也会变黑。
My second advice is that we must distinguish between categories and learn to shift our perspectives.,我要讲的这个第二条，是分清这个范畴，转变视角。
"Category is an important object in philosophical study, and also a crucial tool for us to think. ",范畴是哲学研究的这个重要对象，也是我们每个人呃思考问题的重要工具，
We use categories to analyze and study.,我们用呃概念啊范畴来分析问题，来研究对象。
Take corruption for example.,我以这个腐败现象作为例子来做一个说明。
What makes us especially pessimistic is the corruption prevalent in our society. ,让我们特别不乐观的是社会当中存在的许许多多这个呃腐败现象，
It is irritating and seems invincible.,那么多腐败现象，我们不仅愤怒，而且无奈。
Our powerless feelings might easily turn into pessimism. ,无这种无奈尤其呃会造成呃我们不乐观的这种情绪。
Why do we feel powerless?,为什么无奈？
"Because there are so many things that are underlying corruption, such as economic transformation, diversified values, temptation of profits, malicious maneuvering, loopholes of regulations, poor supervision, bad traditions, and a societal lack of morality.",有多多少少因素在腐败现象背后？啊经济转型、价值多元、啊这个呃市场诱惑、坏人作祟，对吧，呃制度不严、这个监管不力，对吧，呃传统腐朽、啊这个世风不良等等等等。
"With so many factors at work, how long exactly will it take to eradicate corruption?",那么多因素在起着作用，这个腐败现象何时能了？
There are good reasons for our anxiety. ,这种忧虑不是完全没有道理，
"And corruption aside, we are also worrying about ourselves.",而且我们还在忧虑的时候其实还在忧虑自己。
"What if, as time goes on, we ourselves are dragged into degeneration too?",长此以往，连我们自己都很难洁身自好，怎么办？
I'd like to answer the question from the perspective of sheer logic of thinking.,那么我想从思维方式的角度来呃回答一下这样问题。
"When we are aware that so many factors are incurring corruption, have we ever thought that those factors are actually causes, not reasons, for corruption?",当我们考虑腐败有那么多因素在起作用的时候，我们有没有想过这些因素其实都是腐败的原因，而不是腐败的理由。
What's the difference between causes and reasons?,这个原因和理由的区别在什么地方呢？
"Causes are sure, or very likely, to lead to a result. They are independent from our own will.",原因它总会造成结果，呃当然有时是有一定的概率会造成结果，和我们的意愿没有关系。
"Reasons, however, only apply to our intentional behavior.",而理由这个概念只能用在我们有意选择的这个行为之上。
They have to be approved by our will first if they want to work on us.,这些原因要在我们身上发挥作用的话，一定要通过我们的自愿的这个选择。
"So if we use the causes to justify our corruption, we are to a large degree treating ourselves as a mere link on the cause-and-effect chain, which allows us no right to choose and no chance to let our free will work. ",所以如果我们用腐败的这些原因来为我们自己的这个呃腐败行为做辩护的话，我们在很大程度上是把自己看做是一个因果链上的一环，不由我们自己的选择，容不得我们自由意志发挥作用，
That easily results in our corruption.,就自然而然就造成了呃一个腐败的这个现象。
"If we let corruption occur in that way, we are actually degrading ourselves, for we are denying the fact that we can choose and we have a free will.",如果我们这样来描绘我们假如有腐败行为的话是这样产生的话，其实我们是对自己的贬低，我们是否定了自己所具有的选择能力和自由意志。
"In short, there might be hundreds of causes for corruption, but we never have a reason to yield to it.",所以我想说的是腐败中纵然有千百个原因，但是它绝没有一条理由。
"With that in mind, we will never have to worry about whether we ourselves will get corrupted too.",这一点如果我们自己认清了，我们就用不着担心我们总有一天也会同流合污。
"If all those who detest corruption can see that, then perhaps the entire sense of morality of our society might change for the better. ",这一点如果每一个痛恨腐败现象的人们都能够清醒认识到的话，那么我想对于整个社会的风气的这个改善，
About that vision we should be more optimistic.,我们是可以有非常乐观的预期的。
"So this is an example of distinguishing categories, which helps us catch a glint of hope even in the darkness of dejection, and see the silver lining on a cloud.",那么这个是是分清这个范畴，分清范畴可以使我们从失落当中看到希望，从阴影背后看到光明。
I want to give another example. ,我举个例子。
"Suppose there are two men, both of whom were once homeless for a while in early youth. ",假定有两个人，少年的时候都有流浪街头的这个经历，
"But when they grew up, one became a writer, while the other ended up being a prisoner. ",但是一个成年后成了作家，另一个长大后沦为囚徒。
"We may infer that, the same experience of being once homeless must have different meanings for the two. ",大家想一想，同样的少年流浪街头的这个经历，在作家的记忆当中的意义和在囚徒的记忆当中的意义是不是一样。
They must be drastically different.,肯定是非常非常不一样。
And why are we sure about that?,为什么会不一样？
Because what happens to a person later will give his or her prior experiences a special meaning.,因为他后来的这样一种状态给了他先前的一种状态一个特别的一个意义。
That reminds me of how Steve Jobs once put it: collecting the dots.,这个呢我就想起这个呃要借用这个乔布斯的呃一个说法，他叫：collecting the dots。
"Life is full of experiences which are like dots that will form a line. The meaning of a prior occurrence depends on how we would link it with a future occurrence, and how we would collect those dots.",就是人生一个一个事件就好像一个一个点一样，过去事件的意义取决于我们把它同往后的事件啊什么样的事件相联系，以什么样的方式来collecting the dots。
That explains why we have reasons to be optimistic.,想到这一点，我们就可以来理解为什么我们有理由乐观。
"Even if something terribly regrettable, or some disastrous event like what we've experienced, happens, its meaning will not be limited, but rather, open-ended. ",哪怕先前所发生的非常遗憾的事情，哪怕已经呃我们曾经经历过的甚至灾难性的这个事件，它的意义也不是封闭的，而是开放的；
A thing never just happens. It keeps coming around edifying us. ,不是完成时，而是呃进行时。
Think about the memoirs or biographies we read. ,我们想象一下，我们读这个回忆录或者说个人的这个传记，
Those containing an absurd and dispirited youth are always more to our taste.,往往是那些少年荒唐、青春毁颓废的那些传主、啊那些人物的传记我们读起来更加津津有味。
"That's not because we want to imitate the heroes’ absurdity, or appreciate their decadency. ",这不是因为他们的少年荒唐，我们要去模仿；不是因为他们的青春颓废，我们要赞赏；
The real reason is that they overturn their absurd and decadent earlier years by rising to success later in life. ,而是他们用此后的人生成功地改变了他们先前的啊那种荒唐、那种颓废。
"There is another example, which once attracted wide media coverage. Some tourist from China scribbled his name on a relief of Egypt's Luxor Temple,",比方说我想象一下，在这个埃及呃鲁索这个神庙浮雕上刻上呃某某某到此一游的这个事件我们都知道，在这个媒体上都广泛报道了。
We all felt regretful and ashamed about that. ,这件事情我们呃看到都很遗憾甚至呃蛮羞愧的。
But actually the thing has not ended. ,但是这件事情的意义其实还没有完，
Its meaning will largely depend on the performance of Chinese tourists in foreign countries in the future ten or twenty years.,这件事情的意义很大程度上取决于此后的十年或者二十年中国游客在海外会有怎样的表现。
"If one or two decades on, that day finally comes when China is exporting the most civilized tourists of the world, then maybe, this humiliating graffiti incident might even be mentioned as an anecdote.",假如十年以后、二十年以后，从中国国门走出去的是世界上最有教养的游客群体，那个时候人们提起当初某某某在啊啊这个古埃及的这个呃古迹上涂鸦，我们恐怕会作为一段有趣历史的生动情节而提起。
"With this in mind, we have reasons to be optimistic",我们想到这一点，我们应该有理由乐观。
We should have faith and strive for the arrival of that day!,坚信有这么一天，并且为这么一天到来努力奋斗！
"That is how I understand optimism. It is a responsibility, and also a piece of wisdom.",这就是我所理解的乐观，它是一种责任，也是一种智慧。
Thank you!,谢谢大家！
"""There is nothing difficult for us to do in the world. If we deal with them, difficult things become easy; if we don't, the easy things become difficult.""",“天下事有难易乎，为之，则难者亦易矣；不为，则易者亦难矣。”
I believe you are all familiar with the saying.,上面这句段话大家应该很熟悉。
"It’s from an article in a junior high school textbook entitled, ‘To Learn’.",是出自于我们初中课本一篇叫《为学》的文章。
The article tells us a very simple lesson that there is no such things as difficult or easy.,它讲了一个非常简单的道理，这天下的事有困难的和简单的吗。
"If you take action, difficult things will become easier; otherwise, easy things will become difficult to accomplish later.","只要你做了，再难的也变简单了；如果你不做,再简单的，它就变成更难了。"
"These things happen to us often, don't they?",这样的事儿，在我们身边是不是经常发生？
"We all have lots of dreams that we want to achieve as kids, but how many dreams are fulfilled?",我们从小到大有很多梦想，有多少件事儿你去实现了呢？
I heard a story about a girl named Rain at the U.S. Pavilion during the 2010 World Expo.,在2010年世博会的时候，我看到这样的一个故事，美国馆有一个小女孩，这个小女孩叫瑞恩。
She found a trashed vacant in her neighborhood that was full of construction waste.,在她家小区里边发现有一个建筑垃圾堆放的一个卫生死角。
So she wondered if it was possible to change that area into a beautiful garden?,她就想是不是可以通过她的行动把这个卫生死角变成一个美丽的花园。
She took action.,她行动了。
She took a pot of flowers from her home and planted them there.,她把自己家里的花捧出来种在那个卫生死角。
"When she was about to plant the second one, she found her flowers were stepped on by a group of teenage hipsters in her neighborhood.",但是她当转身拿第二盆的时候，那个花却被社区的嬉皮少年给踩了。
"However, she didn't give up.",但她并没有放弃。
She continued to keep planting flowers.,一而再再而三地去种花。
"After a while, her action moved the once indifferent neighbors in her community and they carried out the recontruction plan of the beautiful garden together.",最终她的行动感动了社区里冷漠的那些邻居们，跟她一起完成了这个美丽花园的建设计划。
"In addition, every household in the community started planting flowers on their balconies, making the whole community more lively and colorful.",不光如此，接下来整个社区每家每户都在阳台种起了花，使得这个社区变得春意盎然。
"I don't know how you felt after watching the video, but what I thought was, ""Will things like this ever happen in our country? Will things like this ever happen in my community?""",我不知道大家看这个片子的时候，有没有什么感触，当时我的感触就是“诶，这样的事情，会在我们的国家发生吗？会在我自己生活的社区发生吗？”
"About six months later after watching the video, I went to Shenzhen for a volunteer project on June 2011.",看了这片子以后差半年多的时间，在2011年的6月份，我有一次去深圳做一个志愿者项目。
"I visited a very beautiful beach called Xichong beach, in Nan'ao county, Shenzhen.",我到了深圳的一个很美丽的沙滩，在南澳，叫西冲沙滩。
"At that time, the beach was not fully commercialized, so there were only guesthouses.",那个沙滩因为是一个还没有被完整的商业开发的一个沙滩，所以当地只是有民宿。
"Young people liked to camp there on the beach, and numerous tents were pitched along the one-kilometer-long coastline.",当地的年轻人喜欢在沙滩上面露营，在长达一公里的这样的一个海岸线上搭满了帐篷。
"We call it Chinese-style camping, but what exactly is that?",我们把它称之为中国式露营，什么是中国式露营呢？
You may have guessed it.,大家可以猜得到。
"When the young people left, they left many things behind. Like what?",当他们离开的时候，拔完营会留下很多东西，什么呢？
Garbage.,垃圾。
"Yeah, they left, but they also left the garbage behind them.",对，他们走了，留下的那一片片垃圾。
Some of them even buried the garbage in the sand.,有些人甚至把垃圾用沙子埋一埋。
So later people could hurt their feet when stepping on the garbage.,那可能会使后面的人踩上去踩破了脚。
"I went there to swim, but when I saw what it looked like I hesitated.",我是去游泳的，当我看到这个景象的时候，我犹豫了。
Can I swim in a sea like this?,我还能游吗？
The waves came up and swept away a plastic bowl of instant noodles.,一个浪上来，一个泡面碗下去了。
Then another wave came and carried away some cigarette butts.,一个浪上来，一堆烟头下去了。
"If I swam in there, with one breath I might take in half of the noodles, and with another breath three cigarette butts.",如果我去游泳，哈一呼吸，半碗面，哈一呼吸，三个烟头。
I couldn't swim in there.,无法游泳。
Should I just leave or take action?,这时候我是选择走开，还是选择行动？
I thought about Rain and decided to take action.,我想到瑞恩那个小女孩，我要行动。
I wanted every visitor on the beach to clean it with me.,我要让沙滩上的游客跟我一起收拾这个沙滩。
I started to observe and found several groups of people packing up to leave.,我开始观察，我发现在沙滩上，有那么几个团队正在拔营。
I ran over to help them and find out their leader.,我就跑上前，诶帮他们先拔营，一边拔营一边观察谁是他们领头的。
"A girl shouted, ""Don't forget your stuff"".",有个女孩子张罗：“唉，别忘落东西别忘落东西。”
"Oh, she must be someone in charge.",哦，应该是个小头目。
"You know, I went towards her to be the considerate Shanghai guy and I helped carry her bags.",我就上去发挥了我们上海男生的优势，替她拎包。
"I carried her bags to their meeting point and she thanked me, ""Thank you! Which group are you in?""",然后帮他们把包放到他们的集合点，放下以后，她感谢我，“诶谢谢你！你是哪个组的？”
"Then she told me that people there were not from the same company, but were online friends who gathered together for a party.",哦，她告诉我信息原来他们其实也不是一个单位的，可能就是网友大家聚集在一起。
They didn't know each other very well.,互相之间并不熟识。
"""I am not with you guys, I am just a visitor."" I replied.",我说：“哦，我不是你们一起的，我是游客。”
"""Wow! That's very kind of you.""",“哇！那你真是太好心了。”
"""But I am here as a volunteer.""",“不过我今天有个身份，我是志愿者。”
"""A volunteer? Volunteer for what?""",“志愿者？干什么的？”
"""I am here as a volunteer to recruit more volunteers.""",“我今天的身份更特别的是，我是招募志愿者的志愿者。”
"""Recruit them for what?""",“招募志愿，那你要干嘛呢？”
"""It was nice of you to collect and take your garbage away, but you see, the beach is still very dirty, right?""",我说:“诶，你们离开的时候挺好的把垃圾都收拾走了，但是呢你看这沙滩是不是很脏？”
"""Yes, indeed.""",“唉，是很脏”。
"""So is it possible for all of you to stay here for one more hour and clean the beach with me?""",“你们能不能留下来跟我一起做一个一小时的清洁沙滩的志愿者行动？”
"""I don’t think we have enough time because we are gather for meals and we have a training after that. Plus, our leader is not around, he went to find the bus.""",“哎呀，可能不太方便，因为我们现在集合马上吃饭，吃完饭以后我们有一个培训，没有时间了，而且我们老大也不在，老大去联系大巴去了。”
"So, I got rejected.",拒绝。
I insisted.,我说。
"""How about this? Let's make a bet. If I win, all of you will collect garbage with me, but if I lose, I will do it by myself.""",“这样，我给大家打个赌，如果这个赌我赢了，请大家跟我去捡垃圾；如果这个赌我输了，我一个人去捡垃圾。”
I wasn't really trying to make a bet.,其实我并不是指望大家真的愿意跟我打个赌。
"I just wanted to draw people's attention and let them know that, as a volunteer I don't quit easily.",我只是为了大家继续被我的目标所吸引，能够知道我是一个不轻易放弃的一个志愿者。
I went back to my place and grabbed a board game that we invented by ourselves.,我回到我住的地方拿来了一个我们自己研发的一个游戏。
"It's called ‘Green Walking’, to remind us to protect the environment and travel using low carbon emissions.",这个游戏呢，叫绿行棋，讲的就是出行当中我们要爱护环境，要低碳出行。
"So I told her male companions, ""If any of you can rip the board game's cloth apart, you win. If you can't, I win.""",我就跟所有当天的那些他们的同伴说：“哪一个男生如果能够把我这个游戏的棋布给撕烂了，算我输，如果你们撕不烂，我赢。”
"A few guys tried, but failed.",啊上来几个男生，撕不烂。
"Of course, because the cloth was made of special materials.",对，因为我用了特殊的材质做了这个棋布。
"Apparently, I won the bet.",很显然这个赌我赢了。
"Eventually, their leader came back.",这时候他们的老大来了。
"So I asked him, ""Excuse me, can you please do me a favor? Would you let them stay for an hour and do some voluntary work?""",他们老大跑上来，我说：“诶，老大，能不能帮个忙？组织你的队友们留下来一个小时，我们做个志愿者行动。”
"""I am really sorry, but we don't have the time"", he replied.",那老大说：“哎呀，实在不好意思，我们真没时间。”
I got rejected again.,还是拒绝。
"Then I insisted, ""So how about half an hour?""",我说：“半小时行不行？”
"""I am really sorry but our bus has arrived. And the AC on the bus is already on.""",“哎呀，真不好意思，我们大巴已经到了，空调已经打开了。”

"Reading it, I found one of Chairman Mao's quotes.",我一翻啊里面看到有毛主席语录
"During the Cultural Revolution, we used to have Chairman Mao’s quotes printed on the textbooks, but usually just on the first page, not on every one.",这个呢我文化大革命呢，当然我们有毛主席语录印到课本上，但一般都在头一页就有了，不是里面每一页都有的。
It surprised me to find the quotes on the inner pages of the textbook as well.,诶这个是在里页都夹着有，这让我很吃惊。
"The quotes went, ""All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience.""",讲了一句什么话呢，“一切真知来自于直接经验”。

I had been to the United States for many times.,所以我到美国去访问多次。
"In my conversation with some American professors, they expressed similar concerns.",有的跟美国教授谈，他们也在worry。

We were worried that people spent so much time working in the virtual world that some of them even chose to date in the virtual world.,"就是老是working in the virtual world，老在虚拟世界活动,甚至谈恋爱咱们都不能面对面谈，都网恋。"
"Over time, people may suffer from mental health issues and forget what it is like to live in the real world.",这样搞多了心里要出毛病，忘掉了在真实世界里是什么样。
My view is that we need to have the self-confidence to pursue courses of the greatest value with our best resources with an eye to solving real-world problems.,所以我觉得我们一定要有这个自信心去拿最好的东西最真实的东西做最大的事情。
This is the second story.,这第二个故事。
Here comes the third story.,第三个故事。
"Last year in December, as a member of the delegation of the China Association for Science and Technology, I went to Kyoto for the World Engineers Convention.",就是去年十二月份，我参加中国科协的这个代表团，我们到京都去参加这个世界工程师大会。
The meeting was a huge success.,这个会呢开得很成功。
"At the end of the meeting, the president of the Japanese delegation asked, ""Professor Liu, would you do a speech on behalf of all the foreign guests?""",会议结束的时候，日本的主席就要求说：“刘教授，你能不能代替所有的国外来宾，做一个发言。”
"I felt that this invitation showed their approval for China, so I gladly accepted it.",我觉得这个对中国也是地位的承认，挺好，欣然同意。
The president himself talked about China briefly in his speech.,但是他在开始的时候呢就讲了一点中国，讲了什么呢。
He mentioned two things in particular.,讲了两件事情。
"The first thing he mentioned was China's high-speed rail, which has a top speed of 350 kilometers per hour.",一个，中国的高铁，啪，一个高铁在放出去了，中国的高铁每小时最高速度到了350公里。
He thought this speed had its problems.,这是有问题的。
"Of course, I knew the high speed had its problems, but I wanted to hear his view on it.",当然什么问题我也知道一些，但是我想听听你讲中国有什么问题。
"However, he just stopped there.",不讲啦。
The second thing he mentioned was that China was no longer a developing country.,然后呢中国啊，第二点，中国现在就说不能说是一个发展中的国家了。

"""It is a developed country.""",是一个发达国家了。
The president was nice to say so but it was obviously an overstatement.,我一听高抬我们了。
No wonder he invited me to do the speech on behalf of the other foreign delegations.,所以最后呢这个就让我做代表去发言。
"So in my speech, I said, ""Mr. President, first, I would like to correct one point regards what you said about China. China is still a developing country. We are still faced with many challenges, such as population issues, resource issues, pollution and natural disasters.""","我做代表发言之后呢，我就说：“刚才主席先生，讲到中国，我先希望correct one point ,第一中国仍然是一个发展中国家，我们还有很多问题没有解决，比方说人口问题、资源问题、污染问题和自然灾害的问题。”"
"""We hope to learn from the rest of the international community. We are willing to learn from the developed countries their good practices, but we are also mindful that we do not go through the same process of trial and error.",“我们希望向大家学习，我们希望请教发达国家有什么先进经验，我们想听，但是我也告诉大家，我们也注意到发达国家在发展过程中走的弯路，负面的教训。”
"With China's status, some messages have to be sent clearly.",因为中国已经到了这个位置，该说的话就得说了。
I went on to say that China now stood at a joint.,"所以我这个讲话讲完了之后呢，所以我们现在中国呢是at a joint ,在一个节点上。"
What does this joint do?,这个joint就是要干什么呢？
It works to bridge the gap between the east and west.,就是要bridge the gap between the east and west.
China stood on the joint of transforming from a developing country to a developed one.,我们在developing country和developed country节点上。

We have our own strengths.,我们有我们的优势。
We are fully confident towards the future,我们也充满了信心走下面的路。
These were the three stories.,三个故事讲完。
"I hope, at this moment, you all have a better understanding of self-confidence.",我想我对自信的理解大家也明白了。

"With self-confidence, we will have the courage to work on the ground to get first-hand and the most valuable information to advance our society.",我们就敢于到第一线，去得到最真实的最重要的信息来改变我们的社会。

"We must stay calm, for the next century will be the century of “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”!",我们非常冷静，因为下一个世纪呲将是中华民族振兴的世纪！
Thank you!,谢谢大家。
"It's said today is the end of the world, and you must be very disappointed as the world is still spinning.",今天世界末日，地球没有毁灭，让大家失望了吧。
"But somebody said to me, ""wait, we don't know if the sun would rise tomorrow.""",但是有人告诉我说，别着急，明天太阳能不能升起来还不知道。
"In fact, the apocalypse doesn't frighten me at all, but I'm a little worried.",其实我想想，好像世界末日也没什么可怕的，但我有一点点担心。
"For me, it's ok if we perish together.",我的担心是，同归于尽并不可怕。
"But I worry that when I die, you are still living in this world.",我在担心什么呢？就是我死了，你还活着。
This is so unfair.,所以世界是不公平的。
How do we start to ask questions?,我们的问题从哪儿开始呢？
"When I was little, I started asking the most basic questions.",我的起点非常低，小的时候我问的第一个问题应该就是。
The first of them was where I came from.,我从哪里来。
My mom gave me an answer.,这个问题是我妈妈回答我的。
"She said, ""You are fished out from a river"".",她说：“你是河里捞的。”
"Many years later, because of the nature of my job, I met many bigwigs.",后来由于职业的原因，我见到了很多所谓的大人物。
And I asked them where they came from.,我也问过他们这个问题。

"Knowing that today's host, Jiang Changjian, is also from trash cans, I feel so much better.",今天蒋昌建在主持，他也是垃圾桶里捡的，这样我就放心了。
We usually ask questions out of curiosity.,所以我们很多的问题是从好奇心开始的。
"But questions after questions, once our curiosity is appeased, may result from misunderstanding.",但好奇心之后一连串的问题无穷无尽，却往往开始于误解。
The world has seen so many misunderstanings.,这个世界有那么多那么多的误解。
"By becoming a man who makes a living by asking questions, I may add another misunderstanding to this world.",可是我竟然成了一个靠提问为生的人，这也是一个误会。
I never see myself as a wise talker.,我从来都不认为自己是一个会说话的人。
"Since childhood, if somebody asked me to do something as simple as talking to others, I could get cold feet.",从小到大，如果有人跟我讲，你要去做一件事情，这件事情简单到你去找一个人跟他讲一句话就成功了，可是我就真心在那儿纠结。
I once looked up to a man who had an exceptionally big mouth.,后来我曾经有过一个非常仰慕的男人，他的特征很明显就是嘴特别大。
It could have been very romantic if that big mouth was used to eat or kiss.,长着这么一张大嘴，如果用来吃饭和接吻是非常好的一件事儿。
"Sadly, this man used his mouth to talk, for which he was killed at last.",可他偏偏用来说话，后来掉了脑袋。
He is Socrates.,这个人叫苏格拉底。
Socrates's story often has me thinking how hard it is to talk.,所以我常常想，说话究竟是一个多难的事情呢。
"Just as mouth is not only for eating, we talk not only to inform people, but also to clear misunderstandings.",我们长这张嘴，不单纯是为了吃饭，我们说话也不单纯是为了让别人知道，很多时候我们就是为了消除误解。
"However, it really racks our brains to come up with a good question.",可是问一个好问题真的是非常的难。
I have been asking questions for a living for a long time.,我做这个以提问为生的职业已经有不算短的一段时间。
"And I feel lucky because my job is as simple as posing questions, and well-paid.",那当然，这个职业靠着问问题可以拿工资，而且工资还不低，这让我觉得自己很幸运。
"According to my calculation, I have asked over 30 thousand questions in more than 10 years as a TV talk show host.",我算了一下，做了十多年的电视谈话类节目，加起来我问过的问题大概有三万多个吧。
"If I compile those questions into a book, it must be a very thick one, equivalent of the book I have read in my childhood—I Wonder Why.",小时候看过一套书叫《十万个为什么》，那如果把我这三万多个问题变成书，它也应该有很厚很厚的一本。

"I have asked many terrible questions, and I have also got headache and insomnia for drying up my inspiration to ask questions.",我问过很多烂问题，我也常常因为问不出问题会头疼、失眠。
"As you know, my peer Cui Yongyuan, a Chinese TV talk show host, has insomnia too.",当然我的同行崔永元也失眠，不过我比他好看一点。
But I guess being more handsome helps me earn more sympathy than him.,所以更容易获得同情。
"In retrospect, how did I come up with those questions?",我就在想，那我问过的问题中，是从哪儿开始的呢？
What is a good question?,那么什么是好问题？
And what is a terrible one?,什么又是烂问题呢？
"As a matter of fact, it is still beyond my ability to answer these two questions.",实际上到现在我也回答不了。
I don't have a clue about what is a good question.,我根本不知道什么叫做好问题。
"Although ignorant of how to tell a good question, I'm so clear in mind about what a terrible question is like.",可是问过这么多问题之后，我知道什么叫做烂问题。
Most terrible questions are superficial.,那些烂问题都是轻而易举的，非常容易。
"For example, Sophie Marceau has been asked which role she likes most for more than 1 thousand times.",比如说苏菲玛索被问过一千多次你最喜欢哪个角色。
Someone once asked Li Zehou what he did for a living.,李泽厚被问过说，你是干什么的。
There is another terrible question asked by a young journalist who was my co-worker when interviewing the nationwide idol Ge You.,还有我的一个同事，我见过一个很年轻的记者，他要去采访葛优，那当然葛大爷是国宝，人人都喜欢，老少咸宜。
"What should he prepare to nail it? More importantly, he also adores Ge You.",那问题是他也崇拜葛大爷，那么要怎么问呢。
He took that interview very seriously.,他很认真，头一天晚上做功课。
He wrote down the questions in a paper and practiced them over and over again in front of the mirror.,自己对着镜子反复练习，然后把他的问题写下来写在一页纸上。
"I had checked that paper, and there were about 500 words.",我看到那页纸，上面有500多个字。
"As the interview just begun, he started reading the paper to Ge You in case he should forget any details.",他怕自己忘了，所以见到葛大爷就拿着纸开始念。
"In his mind, this would never be a terrible question.",这总归不会是很差的一个问题吧。
"But when he finished reading, Ge You answered in this manner, ""Well, I think you have asked a very funny question"".",等他把这个问题问完之后，葛大爷是这么回答的：“对，我觉得你说的有点儿意思。”
"If I were that journalist, I would have sweated right away on hearing such a reply.",如果是我，我估计汗就下来了。
Even now I often ask some terrible questions like he did.,可是到现在我也常常会问一些让自己流汗的问题。
"After all, a good question is really hard won.",所以一个真正的好问题并不那么容易获得。
I have to practice many times.,我需要很多次练习。
"It is strange that whenever I tell others that I am not smart, they seem not to believe it.",我常常跟别人说我特别笨，那奇怪的是好像他们不太相信。
"As a result, I have to practice over and over again behind the scene.",所以我只好非常小心地很谨慎地一遍一遍地躲起来练。
Where did I start the practice?,这个练习从哪里开始？
"In 1999, when I was making a documentary program in Beijing, I shot a video named Brothers during an interview.",1999年，我在北京，我做一档纪录片节目，当时去采访，我记得我拍了一个片子叫做：兄弟。

"A computer was worth over CNY 10,000 in 1999, as a result,  he may be sentenced to 10 years in prison accumulatively.",在当年一台电脑大概一万多块钱，所以这个总额加起来他可能会被判刑10年。

"He carried with a woven bag that you all are familiar with, put it down, and then took something out wordlessly.",他拿了一个你们知道那个编织袋吧，放在地上，不说话，开始往外掏。

"As our floor is tiled, I could clearly hear the crisp ""clang"" sound when his kneeled down on the tiles.",我们办公室的地板是瓷砖的，我听到人的膝盖骨磕在瓷砖上的声音，“当”的一下，很脆。
I could hardly understand why a nearly 70-year-old elder would kneel down in front of a 24-year-old man.,那一年我24岁，我就不明白一个将近70岁的老人他为什么会跪在我的面前。
It was due to my identity—a journalist.,因为我有一个身份，我叫记者。

"I have been thinking since 2007 if there is a way to directly donate to those in need, rather than to charity organizations?",两千零七年的时候呢我就在思考这个问题，我在想，有没有办法把这些钱直接捐给项目而不是捐给组织？
"In the case of charity organizations, if there is no proper regulation or supervision, they might spend donated money on other purposes without informing those who made the donations, which is the root cause of all problems.",把钱捐给组织，但是对它没有监管就是给了它无尽的一个权利，它就有很大的权力去花掉这笔钱却不告知你，这是一切问题发生的根源。

"He has received an admission letter, but he is not able to afford his tuition.",考上了，录取通知书也拿到了，但是他交不起学费。
"Although he can take a part-time job, how will he pay his tuition for his freshman year?",他可以入学之后再去打工，但是第一年的学费怎么办？
The cost of a college student for one year is 5000 Yuan.,供养一个大学生读一年的书，5000块。
So we put these two programs on the website.,两个项目都放在网上。
Which one will you donate to?,那各位如果是你的话，你会把钱捐给哪一个项目？
"You don't have to donate lots of money, like 500,000 Yuan.",假如说我有五块钱，你不一定要捐50万。
"Suppose I have 5 Yuan, I may donate 4 Yuan to the primary school, and 1 for the college student.",但是呢我有五块钱，如果是我的话我可能会捐，可能啊我可能会捐四块钱给这个山区的小学，捐一块钱给那个大学生。
You could also donate all 5 to the student; it's your choice.,当然你也可能会把五块钱都给那个大学生，这是你的选择。
"My choice may be to donate 4 Yuan to the rural school, then this program will receive 4 Yuan from me.",那我的选择可能是捐4块钱给这个山区的小学，那这样这个小学的这个项目就会有我4块钱的捐款。
Is that enough?,够不够呢？
"No, it's not even close.",还不够。
"As a donor, you certainly have your own values and judgments, and maybe some of you share the same ideas as me.",那你也是一个捐赠者，你有你的价值观，你有你的判断，也许在座的各位中间有一些人跟我有一样的想法。
"Like this, one person donates 7 Yuan, another donates 8, and some donate 20 Yuan.",他也捐了7块钱，那个人捐了8块钱，有的人捐了20块钱给这个小学的项目。
"A computer programmer could create a progress bar, and then donation after donation, 3,000 Yuan are quickly raised.",最后就看，IT男脑海中间想象出一个滚动条，那啪啪啪啪啪滚滚滚，很快，3000块钱捐满了。
"Actually, it's very meaningful to help others, and it really matters.",有的时候啊，我们去帮助一个人很重要，帮助一个人非常重要。
Too many people in China need help.,中国有太多的人需要被帮助。
But I feel it is more important to get more people engaged in readily helping others.,但是呢，我觉得更多的时候我们要让更多的人愿意去帮助别人这点更重要。
"If 30 million out of 1.3 billion people in China are desperate for help, then I would like to persuade the majority to help those in need.",3000万人需要被帮助，有十三亿人愿意去帮助别人，我宁愿去帮助这十三亿人，让他有帮助别人的愿望。
"As for this 3,000 Yuan, either 1,500 people can each donate 2 Yuan, or one person can donate 3,000. Which do you prefer?",所以，当你一个人捐两块钱，1500人捐满这3000块，还是一个人捐3000块把它捐满？
"I would prefer if 1,500 people could each donate 2 Yuan.",我宁愿是1500人每人捐了两块钱。
"So when the 'progress bar' gradually draws near to its end, perhaps hundreds of people have contributed to it, even if they each only gave a few coins.",那么当这个滚动条滚满的时候可能有几百人为这个项目捐款，而每个人只捐了一点点的几块钱而已。
"Typically we donate our money to a collections box, and that's it—we don't even know what happens to our donation.",平常我们把钱捐到一个捐款箱之后，事情就已经结束了，因为你不知道后面发生了什么。
"But in the case of a website, the case has just begun when the 3,000 Yuan is raised.",但是在这个平台上当这个3000块捐满之后，其实才刚刚开始。
"With the raised money, the organization behind the website has to implement this particular charity case according to its original goal and plan, because it needs to make regular progress updates.",因为这个公益组织拿到了钱之后，它必须要非常严格地按照它当时募款的目标和计划去执行这个项目，它需要定期地来更新这个项目的进展。
"It's as though they first purchase all the construction materials, and next they contact a construction team.",我今天去买到了很多的一些建材，后来找到了一个施工队。
"This team gradually builds a wall, a ceiling, and then finishes painting.",然后施工队呢又粉刷了，然后砖也砌好了，墙也盖好了，顶也弄好了。
"Pictures are then posted one after another, and emails and texts are sent to donors saying that the toilet is under construction.",一张一张照片贴出来了，然后你就会不断地收到邮件和短信告知你说，诶这个东西已经慢慢成形了。
"And one day, it's finally completed.",最后，建好了。
"And it seems like the 2 Yuan you donated was really worth 4, and you are treated like a customer on Taobao.",你会觉得哇我原来我捐了两块钱就像我捐了四块钱，也享受到了像淘宝买家一样的待遇。
The charity website keeps asking you for a good review.,而且它会不断地来找你说，亲，你能给我一个好评吗。
Why?,为什么？
"In the end, every donor will review the program.",因为在这个项目结束的时候，每一个捐款的人都需要都被要求给这个项目本身做一个评价。
How much your comment matters corresponds to your donation.,这个评价，是完全根据我捐款的比率而来算权重的。
"If I contribute 4 Yuan to the 3,000, then I have four three-thousandths of the reviewing rights, accordingly.",三千块钱我捐了4块，我就有三千分之四的权利来为这个项目打分。
"If the best review possible is 5 stars, then I might offer 3 stars, or perhaps even 5 stars.",我可能会打3分，可能会打5分，假如满分是5分的话，我可能会打3分、5分。
"Why 3 or 5 stars? I don't know, but I just feel happy to do so.",我到底为什么打3分、5分我也不知道，但是我觉得开心我觉得满意。
The transparency of the whole process leaves me with the impression that charity websites are professional and care about how I feel.,我觉得你给我了很多的透明，你做得很专业，我觉得你很照顾捐款人的感情。
Maybe that's why I give them 5 stars.,我就给你打高分。
"And if so, the charity organization will be inclined to think that in order to get a higher score, they must consider at every step how their donors feel.",那这个时候作为一个公益组织来说，它就想，为了得到这个高分，我就必须得前期的每一项工作都要考虑到捐款人是怎么想的。
"What the donors care the most about is either professionalism or efficiency, or ultimately how those in need benefit from the charity program.",捐款人想的无非就是专业，有效率，更加好的去执行，这个项目得到了受益人真正的受益。
But why do they pay so much attention to your reviews?,所以，但是它为什么会这么关注你的评价呢？
This is because the charity organization will begin with your nice review and gain an increasingly better reputation.,当我们给它了一个好评，这个公益组织它就会积分就会越来越高。
"Their reputation might initially be rated as a single star, then as a diamond, and then finally as a golden crown.",它可能一开始一颗星，后来变成一颗钻石，再后来变成一颗皇冠。
Other organizations may not have such a good reputation.,那另外一个公益组织呢可能做得没有那么好。
"For example, they may have only three or four stars.",它可能就是三颗星或者是四颗星而已。
"So the next time you intend to donate or others contribute to a new program, you will all first check the charity organization's rating.",当下一次你再去捐款的时候，或者别人再来捐款在另外一个项目的时候，那我自然而然会看这个公益组织以前的评价。
"No charity organization can survive without a budget, so they need a certain cut from the money collected to serve as management fees and salaries for their employees.",每一个公益组织它都是要有自己的花费的，它需要提取一定的管理费，发给这个公益组织的工作人员的工资。
"Now imagine this, a two-crown charity organization charges an 8% management fee while a three-star organization only charges 5%.",甚至当这个两皇冠的公益组织，它收取的管理费，打个比方，8%；另外一个三颗星的公益组织它收取的管理费5%。
"So which one do you choose: the one with the two-crown rating and an 8% management fee, or the other with the three-star rating and a 5% management fee?",那么又一个问题摆在大家面前了，你会去把钱捐给一个两个皇冠，但是8%管理费的公益组织，还是会把钱捐给一个三颗星，但是5%的公益组织？
"We all have different values and judgments; some will choose the former despite its high charges, because it has a good reputation, so they trust it and believe that their donation will make a difference through this organization.",每个人都有自己的价值观，每个人都有自己的判断，会有一部分人把钱捐给双皇冠的，虽然它的管理费比较高，但是因为我相信它，我信任它，它以前做得比较好，我相信它拿到这个钱之后可以发挥真正的价值。
"Although the latter only charges 5%, donors may suspect that the remaining 95% cannot truly be helpful in its hands.",而那个三颗星的虽然它收了5%，但是呢，其它的95%也许不能发挥那95%的真正的意义。
I would also prefer to make contributions to the former who charges 8%.,我可能宁愿把钱捐给这个8%的公益组织。
What's the meaning of this?,那这样有什么好处？
This is so that the charity organizations with high ratings can grow.,这样就会让那些公益组织就会变得越来越壮大。
"The more transparent and efficient they are, the more massive and trustworthy they become.",所以必须得让自己透明，必须得让自己专业，可以在这个平台上变得越来越壮大。
"Suppose you donate 20 Yuan monthly, no matter to what cause.",当公益组织越来越壮大，各位假如说你平均每个月捐二十块钱，随便捐到哪里去，你平均每个月捐二十块钱。
"Now with their development, every detail of your contribution can be tracked.",当有一个公益的平台，你捐在这上面的每一分钱都可以被仔仔细细地去跟踪的时候。
So will you still drop your coins into a collections box only to have no idea what happens next?,你还会把钱捐到一个你不知道去哪里的箱子里吗？
"Looking back, we can see that a famous charity organization once only raised 143,000 Yuan.",回过头来看曾经有一家非常知名的公益组织，今天只募到了14.3万元。
"One day when this website is collecting more money due to its transparency, that particular charity organization may have a moment of introspection, asking themselves,  'What should we do? Should we be transparent?'",等到未来有一天，这个平台上通过非常透明的方法能够募到很多钱的时候，它可能需要反思自己“我怎么办？我是要让自己也变得透明呢？
Or should we just raise money on this website?',还是说我要到这个平台上去募款？”
"I hope that in the future a platform like this website can put all charity organizations on the right track, soothing donors whose hearts have been broken before.",我希望通过这个平台能够帮助所有的优秀的公益组织变得越来越优秀，能帮助每一个捐款者能够重建那颗曾经被伤害过的慈善家之心。
"The boss of the boss of the boss of my boss is Bill Gates, and he has a friend called Warren Buffett.",我的老板的老板的老板的老板叫做Bill Gates先生，他有个好朋友叫做沃伦巴菲特。
"Bill Gates is very outstanding in his industry, and we have every reason to say that he is one of the richest men in the world.",Bill Gates先生他是在实业这个领域里面做得特别突出，可以说是做到今天最有钱的人之一了。
"Meanwhile, Warren Buffett is a pillar of the financial arena, one of the most successful men in finance.","而沃伦巴菲特先生呢,他是在金融这个领域里面做得特别优秀，也可以说是在这个领域里面做到今天最成功的人之一。"
"One is from industry, and the other is from finance.",一个是实业一个是金融。
"Industry is about creation while finance allocates resources to those who create, distributing quality resources to those engaged in entrepreneurship.",实业是把一件事情做出来，而金融是为了配给资源给那些能够做事情的人，把优质的资源配给那些优质的企业家。
They have intriguing ways of supporting charities.,而这两位做公益的方法也非常有意思。
"As for Bill Gates, he set up the Gates Foundation, which concentrates on global issues, like the prevention and treatment of HIV, poverty in third world countries, etc.",Bill Gates先生做公益， 他去成立了一家叫做盖茨基金会，盖茨基金会呢，他就去关注啊艾滋病的防治问题，第三世界国家的贫困问题，等等一些这样的世界性的一些大的问题、难题。
"In addition, he travels all over the world to handle the welfare problems encountered by the Foundation.",他在到处飞到处跑去解决一些公益上的一些问题。
"What Warren Buffett has done is also interesting, as he said, ""How I contribute to charity is to donate dozens of billions of dollars to Bill Gates.""",而沃伦巴菲特先生他做公益呢很有意思，他说我做公益，我就把我的这几百亿美金捐给那个叫Bill Gates的先生。
Because he thinks Bill Gates can probably do better than him.,因为他认为我自己做得未必一定能比他做得更好。
He just sticks to a proven belief: allocate quality resources to a visionary entrepreneur.,把优质的资源配置给那些优质的企业家，是金融这个领域的一个理念。
"As introduced by the host, I love travelling, and I have been to both the Gobi Desert and Antarctica.",刚才主持人介绍，我很喜欢旅行，我去过戈壁，去过南极。
This July I'm going to the North Pole.,今年的七月份呢我要去北极点。
This time I expect to do something unusual at the North Pole.,我要去北极点这个地方我要做一件很有意思的事情。
"That is, I would like to bring back from the North Pole some ice that has been frozen for thousands of years.",就是我要从北极点那里采回一些，最少应该能采回一些千年的寒冰。
"With the ice that I bring back, I will make some necklaces in the shape of water droplets, and I will give them to volunteers who have contributed greatly to charity.",我会采回那一些冰回来，把它做成一滴一滴的滴水项链，把千年寒冰挂在你的胸前，我会带回这样的千年寒冰做的滴水项链送给那些泉公益做出贡献的志愿者。
I wish you all help to bring transparency to this lofty cause in China.,希望大家都能热心地参与推动中国的公益的透明。
"There are so many donations in the world, and it's my wish that all of them can be spent transparently and responsibly on the purposes that they were meant for.",全世界有这么多的捐款，我非常希望这些捐款都能非常透明、非常专业地花在它应该花的地方。
The power of professionalism and trust lies in transparency.,因为透明的力量就是专业的力量，透明的力量就是信任的力量。
Thank you all!,谢谢大家！
"First, please take a look at the pictures on the screen.",我想先请大家看一看上面的图片。
Some pictures about paragliding.,这是一些滑翔伞的图片。
What are the first words that come to your mind at this point?,我想问一下这个时候在大家脑海里反应出来的词是什么？
"Cool, free!",酷、自由!
"Yes, paragliding is a sport that can set you free.",对，滑翔伞是一项非常非常自由的运动。
"Imagine that we are flying at an altitude of 1000 meters, when the blue sky and white clouds are at your back and below you is the vast expanse of the land.",假想一下，我们飞翔在一千米的高空，这个时候你背后是蓝天白云，而你下面是一望无垠的大地。
"At this time, I think you can imagine the feeling of flying high up in the sky.",这时候我想大家都能够想象得到那种真正的天高任鸟飞的感觉。
My first contact with the paragliding was due to one of my friends.,我最开始接触滑翔伞是源自于我的一个朋友。
"One day he called me and said, “Zhuohuan, I’m injured, and I’m going to be discharged from the hospital today. Could you come and give me a hand?”",有一天他给我打电话说：“卓桓我受伤了，今天要出院，你能不能来接我一下？”
"So I went to Jishuitan Hospital, the best orthopedic hospital in Beijing, to pick up my friend.",于是我就到了全北京最好的骨科医院，积水潭医院。
I saw him on crutches with a leg in plaster.,我看到了一个拄着双拐，有一条腿打了石膏的我的这个兄弟。
My friend said that the accident took place when he was flying a paraglider.,我的这个兄弟说他是因为飞滑翔伞。
"When he tried to land, there wasn’t enough height, and he had to make a forced landing in the midair.",在回到降落场着陆的时候，因为没有足够的高度在半路迫降。
"Then he fell to the asphalt road from five meters above, and broke a leg.",那么在五米的时候呢，摔落到了油柏马路上，摔坏了一条腿。
"I was stunned when I heard the word of “paragliding”, as I could never refuse such a fun sport!",那么当时我听到滑翔伞这两个字的时候，我的眼睛就直了，因为这么好玩儿的一个运动我一定要去玩儿！
So I rushed to sign up at a paragliding club the next day.,所以第二天我就去滑翔伞俱乐部报了名。
The paragliding club first gave us an initial training.,滑翔伞俱乐部最开始学习呢，会给我们来初级培训。
"It was actually very simple, as we just learnt some basic knowledge of flying a paraglider.",初级培训其实很简单，会告诉我们一些滑翔伞基本的飞翔知识。
"In simple terms, a paraglider is made up of two pieces of cloth that are sewn up above our head and a piece of cloth at the bottom to hold us, and all are linked with a few ropes.",那么简单来说，滑翔伞是由我们头顶上的两块缝起来的布，以及我们屁股下面一块会兜住我们自己的布，用很多根绳子连起来构成的。
"Among these ropes, there are two important ropes on the left and right side respectively that should be held tight in our hands, as they are used to control brakes.",在这些绳子里面呢，左边有一根右边有一根非常重要的两根绳子会抓在我们手里，叫做刹车绳。
Their function is also very simple.,它的功能也很简单。
"When I pull the left brake rope, the speed on the left will get slower, enabling me to turn left; if I pull the right rope, I will turn right.",就是当我拉下左手刹车绳的时候，左边的速度就变慢了，那么我就会向左转，如果我拉下右手的绳子的话呢，我就会向右转。
"How time flies! In the initial training process, we learnt the basic paragliding skills mainly on the ground.",在初级培训过程中时间过得很快，主要要掌握基本的滑翔技巧，那么主要还是在地面上掌握了。
"When I was about to finish my elementary courses, we went to a hill, a 50-meter-high mound, to test paragliding flight.",初级班毕业的时候呢，我记得很清楚我们是去了一个大约五十米高的山山丘上面，一个土包吧，50米高的土包上面去试飞。
"Then we walked on the hill, spreading out the paraglider against the wind.",那么我们就背着伞走到了这个土包上面，把伞迎着山坡的风铺开。
"When there was wind blowing which is suitable for flying, we would pull up the paraglider and it would be lifted with the wind.",有合适的风吹过来的时候呢，我们就把伞拉起来，因为伞在风吹的过程中会产生升力，那么它就会升起来。
We had to make sure it was indeed on top of my head.,我们要保证它确实在我的头顶。
"When the paraglider was on top of my head, I ran straight down the hill.",那么当伞在我的头顶的时候呢，我就顺着这个山坡儿一直往下跑。
"As I ran faster, the lift force generated by the winds got greater than my weight.",随着我跑动速度的加快，伞翼产生的升力会大于我身体的重力。
So I flew off the hillside probably halfway I ran.,那么大概跑到一半的时候我就会脱离山坡飞起来了。
"I clearly remember that I didn’t fly up high that time, only about five meters high, and I didn’t fly long, presumably five seconds, but that was one of the most impressive paragliding experiences in my life.",我清楚地记得那次我飞的高度不高，大约只有五米；飞的时间也不长，大概有五秒钟，但是那是我有生以来印象最深刻的一次飞行经历之一。
"Because I really experienced that my feet left the ground, I was flying, and I could control my flight.",因为那个时候我是真真正正地感觉到自己双脚离开了地面，我是在飞行，我自己能够控制的飞行。
"After flying over the hill, the coach would take us to fly over the mountain.",那么飞过小山之后，教练会继续带我们去飞大山。
"And this time, we couldn’t fly by ourselves, as we had to learn a lot of stuff in the air that we haven’t known before.",而飞大山的第一次就不能自己去飞了，因为我们需要在空中了解很多第一次在空中以前所不知道的事情。
"For instance, he took us to Mang Mountain in Beijing, paragliding from 500-meter mountaintop.",譬如说我们会去北京的莽山山顶有五百米高，他带着我从莽山上飞起来。
"In the air, he told me that the Ming Tombs Reservoir was just ahead, and there was massive turbulence over the hill on the right front and we should avoid it, take a detour, and fly straight forward.",那他会告诉我说前面是十三陵水库，那么右前方有一个小山包这里面有很多的乱流，不要过去，要绕过去，所以我们要先向前飞。
"Then looking further to the right, we saw a large lawn.",那么再往右看的时候，我们就会看到地面上有一个很大的草坪。
That was our landing site.,这里就是我们的降落场。
"The coach flew with me once to help to acquaint me with the route, and finally landed on the destination.",教练会带着我飞一次航线，最后落到降落场。
"Afterwards, we will go for intermediate training, as my goal is to really fly up in the air, and the intermediate training will tell us some more fundamental flying knowledge.",经过带飞之后呢，我们就要去学习中级培训，因为我的目标是要真正的上天飞行，那中级培训会告诉我们一些更基本的飞行知识。
"For example, the air traffic rules.",比如说在天空中我们的交通规则。
"If two gliders fly towards each other, how to avoid collision?",如果有两个爱好者相向而飞的话，如何避免碰撞呢？
"Very easy, pass on the right side.",很简单，右侧通行。
"In addition to the air traffic rules, what we need to learn is how to gain power while paragliding.",那么除了交通规则以外，我们还需要学习的就是滑翔伞在大自然中如何获取动力。
We know that a paraglider doesn’t generate power itself.,我们知道滑翔伞本身是没有任何动力的。
"So in the process of flying, we can only rely on two airflows to ensure we fly as high as we can.",那么在飞行的过程中，我们只能依靠两种方法让自己能够不是飞得越来越低，而是飞得越来越高。
The first is the dynamic airflow.,第一种方法就是动力气流。
What is the dynamic airflow?,什么是动力气流呢？
That is wind as we usually say.,我们可以理解为平时我们说的风。
Usually a wind blows horizontally.,平时的风会平着吹。
"But when it meets a hillside, the hillside will push the wind to go up.",但是如果它遇到一个山坡的话，风吹过来吹到山坡上，山坡会促使这个风向上走。
"At this time, if we fly above the hillside, we can imagine that the wind will blow us higher and higher.",这时候如果我们在山坡上面来飞行，我们可以想象得到，风会把我们吹得越来越高。
This kind of airflow is called dynamic airflow.,这种气流我们称之为是动力气流。
Another type of airflow we can rely on is called thermal.,另外一种气流我们能够借用的就是叫做热气流。
The principle of thermal is basically related to the fact of solar power heating the ground.,热气流的原理基本上是和太阳能加热地面有关。
"When the ground is heated by solar power, the surface temperature rises, pushing up the air temperature.",当地面被太阳能加热之后，地面的温度升高将地表的空气温度升高。
"When the air expands with heat, it starts to rise.",那么空气热胀冷缩它就会开始上浮。
"When the air starts to rise, we will be lifted up by the thermal if we are paragliding above it.",当地面有空气开始上浮时，我们的滑翔伞如果在这上面飞，就会被从地面升起的空气顶起来。
These are the two basic ways for paragliders to be powered.,那么这两种方式就是滑翔伞获取动力的两种基本方式。
"I can still remember that when I first took off from the Mang Mountain, I flew higher and higher by means of the dynamic airflow.",我还清楚地记得，当我第一次在莽山起飞场上飞起来，然后在山坡上借助动力气流越飞越高，越飞越高。
"And when I overlooked the take-off field, I was very excited and astonished, as I flew with the power of nature.",当我能够俯视起飞场，我当时的心情真是非常非常的激动，因为这是我借助大自然的力量在上升。
"While enjoying freedom and happiness in the air, gliders must pay the most attention to avoid accidents.",而飞行员飞到这个阶段，在享受自由和快乐的同时，最需要注意的一点就是如何避免安全事故。
There are two accidents that I can recall clearly.,在我印象里面有两起印象最深刻的安全事故。
"One was man-made misfortune, and the other was natural calamity.",它们一起可以称之称之为是人祸，而另外一起可以叫做是天灾。
"The former accident happened in 1999, and we called it the “April 28th Accident”.",人祸这一次是这样子的，那是在1999年，我们称它为428天安门事件。
"That day, Mr. Gao Xingzhe, a coach from Beijing Hualian Club, took off from the top of the Mang Mountain near the Ming Tombs Reservoir, which is a common take-off site for us.",那天是北京的华联俱乐部的教练高兴哲，他在北京十三陵水库旁边的莽山，就是我们经常飞伞的地方在山顶起飞。
"After taking off, Mr. Gao made a decision.",高兴哲教练在起飞之后呢，他做了一个决定。
"As he was perhaps in a good mood, he hoped that he could fly a paraglider over the city of Beijing.",他那天可能心情很好，所以他希望自己能够从莽山山顶起飞之后，驾驶滑翔伞飞越北京城。
"It happened to be the north wind blowing, so he kept flying south from the Ming Tombs Reservoir in the north of Beijing.",当天正好是北风，所以他借着风力从北京北侧的十三陵水库一直向南飞。
"After flying over the fourth and the third ring roads, unfortunately he didn’t have enough thermal to keep his height.",飞过了四环三环，可是不幸的是他进了三环之后并没有足够多的热气流来补充高度。
"Then he gradually descended, and it was only a few hundred meters above the ground when he flew into the second ring.",这个时候他的高度不断地降低，飞到二环里面的时候就只有几百米了。
"When he found himself only 200 meters high above the ground, he was just over the Forbidden City, and the only place that he could choose to land was Tian’anmen Square.",当他发现自己只有两百米高度的时候，他当时所处的位置是正处在故宫的上方，他当时唯一可以选择的降落场只有一个地方：天安门广场。
Then he had no choice but to make a landing near the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tian’anmen Square.,所以他只好迫降在了天门广场的英雄纪念碑旁边。
"Once he fell to the Monument to the People's Heroes, he was immediately brought down by the policemen from all directions.",他落在纪念碑旁边之后，马上就被从四面八方冒出来的警察摁倒在地。
Then it took him great efforts to explain to the police that he wasn’t thrown away from the plane!,接下来他就花了很大的力气向这些警察叔叔们解释：我不是被飞机从天上扔下来的。
"He also needed to explain to the police that he didn’t hide the engine, as the policemen didn’t believe he could fly from far away without power.",第二个问题他还要解释：我没有把发动机藏起来，因为警察叔叔不相信他在无动力的情况下能够从很远的地方飞过来。
This paragliding brought him a personal record.,那么这次飞行给他带来一个个人记录。
"He flew a total of two hours, with the maximum height of 3000 meters and the straight line distance of 50 kilometers.",总共飞行的时间历时两小时，他飞行的最高高度有三千米，飞行的直线距离有五十公里。
"With this record, Gao ended his flying career, because he was immediately banned for flying for life and was detained for 15 days, and at the meantime his paragliding club was disbanded.",那么随着这个记录呢，他也结束了自己的飞行生涯，因为他随即即被终身禁赛，还有拘留十五天，同时他的滑翔伞俱乐部也被解散了。
"Though it is free to fly, it doesn’t mean it has no boundary.",所以飞行虽然是自由的，但是也不是有边界的。
The second accident was caused by natural disasters.,那么我我想到的第二个事故呢，是来自于天灾。
"It happened some time in 2007 in Australia, where a global paragliding tournament was held.",这次事情发生在2007年的澳大利亚，那是澳大利亚当年的一场全球滑翔伞锦标赛。
"Halfway through the game, a dark cloud suddenly moved from a distance.",比赛进行到一半的时候，忽然从远处飞来了一片乌云。
"It was so dark, as it was very thick and thick enough to block all the sunlight.",这种云彩它的特点是很黑，之所以很黑是因为它很厚，很厚才能挡住所有的光。
"A cumulonimbus cloud is like a big vacuum cleaner that sucks everything below it, so this kind of cloud often causes hazard when paragliding.",一个积雨云就像一个很大的吸尘器，会非常强烈地吸起它下面的东西，所以这种云彩对滑翔伞运动是非常有害的。
"If a paraglider is unfortunately caught by the cloud, it will be difficult to escape as the speed reaches 10 to 20 meters per second.",如果滑翔伞不幸被云彩吸住的话，这种每秒十米到每秒二十米的速度基本上很难逃脱。
"So when the cloud flew over, all the paragliders chose to give up.",所以当这个云彩飞过来的时候，后面几乎所有的滑翔伞运动员都选择了放弃。
"However, Eva from Germany and He from China still hoped to continue the game, as they didn’t want to throw away their chance to win.",而这时来自德国的Eva以及来自于中国的老何，他们两个还希望继续比赛，他们不希望放弃这个比赛的机会。
They hoped they could catch up with the foregoers before the dark cloud arrives.,所以他们希望在乌云来到之前能够绕过乌云赶上飞在前面的先头部队。
"Unfortunately, the dark cloud flew faster than they flew, and both of them were sucked into the cloud.",然而遗憾的是云彩飞过来的速度比他们飞行的速度快很多，他们两人双双地被吸入了乌云的内部。
"Eva was sucked up to a height of 10,000 meters at a speed of 20 meters per second and the temperature there was only about minus 50 degrees.",Eva被以每秒二十米的速度吸到了高达1万米的高空，那里边的温度大概只有零下50度。
"She was frozen and fainted during the ascent, and was thrown out of the dark cloud when she woke up.",不过她幸运的是在上升的过程中她被冻晕过去了，呵，当她醒过来的时候她已经被云彩抛出了积雨云。
"With the height dropping and the temperature climbing, she slowly regained consciousness and manipulated the paraglider to land.",随着高度的下降温度的上升，她慢慢地恢复了知觉，操纵着滑翔伞迫降了。
The following physical examination showed she only had minor frostbite and no life-threatening injuries.,迫降之后经过检查她只有轻微的冻伤，并没有生命危险。
"However, He wasn’t that lucky.",然而老何就没有这么幸运了。
"After he was sucked into a height of 6000 meters by the cumulonimbus cloud, he was unfortunately struck by lightning and died on the spot.",老何被积雨云吸到了六千米的高空之后，不幸遭遇雷击，当场丧生。
Why were they at risk?,他们为什么会遇到危险呢？
Because they violated the rules.,是因为他们违反了规则。
"The paragliding rules clearly stipulate that first, you can only fly in the designated airspace; secondly, don’t fly under adverse weather conditions, especially when there are cumulonimbus clouds, as they are very dangerous and often can be fatal.",滑翔伞飞行里面有清楚的规则规定，首先只能在允许的空域里面飞行，其次天气不好一定不要飞行，尤其是积雨云，积雨云非常的危险，很多时候都会致命。
"Paragliding accidents occur every year, and most of them happen because gliders violate the rules of the flight.",每年滑翔伞都会出一些事故，在这些事故中绝大部分它的产生，都只是因为我们飞行员没有遵守飞行规则。
"In fact, rules exist in every aspect of our lives.",其实规则存在于我们生活中的很多环节之中。

"It consists of fourteen columns, and each row is a piece of data.",它一共由十四列构成，那每一行的话是一条数据。
"In the first thirteen of them are the data features that we've just talked about, every one of which is described in this chart on the right.",这十四列数据其其中前十三列的话是我们刚才所说的数据特征，就是每一维特征具体描述是在右面这个图中有展示。
The fourteenth column contains the actual house prices arranged according to these features.,那么第十四维的话是我们的真实房价，就这些特征所对应的真实房价。
"We feed these data into the model, it will be trained through iterations, then it will find out a certain relationship between these features and the actual house prices.",当我们把这些数据喂给模型以后，然后模型经过反复的迭代训练，它们就抓到了一些这些某些特征和房价真实房价之间某种关系。
"Then, after multiple iterations, the model is capable of capturing such a relationship.",那么当我们经过很多次迭代之后，那么模型就基本上能够捕获到这种对应关系。
"Then, when we feed new data into the model, it will output a price that it thinks a corresponding apartment could have.",当我们喂给模型一个新的数据，那么它就模型就可以给我们输出一个它认为这些额数据所对应的房子的可能的房价是是什么样子的。
We can do some training and see how such a model training process works.,我们可以训练一下看看这个这样的一个模型训练过程是怎样子的。
"After we have started the training, it will iterate for numerous times.",我们现在开始训练完之后，它会每它会经过无数次的循环迭代。

We can see that the output models are here.,我们可以看一下它输出的模型输出的模型是在这里。
"There are nine in total because one model was saved for every 10 passes, starting from zero.",它一共有九个，因为从零开始，每十个Pass就会保存一项模型。
"Now here we select the model we've saved from the fortieth pass, and use it to predict on our new data.",然后现在我们看一下我们选用第十四个第四十个Pass它保存的模型，对我们的新的数据进行一个预测。
Let's see what our new data look like.,我们看一下我们新的数据是长什么样子。

"Oh, something is wrong!",噢错了！
"Our actual house price is, we can see from here, our actual price is 13.4, and the price we predicted is 13.89.",那我们的真实房价是，这里看得到噢，我们的真实房价是13.4，那么我们预测出来的房价是13.89。
This result is relatively satisfactory since house prices fluctuate quite drastically.,那么这个结果的话是比较比较能够令我们满意的，因为额其实房价波动还是挺大的。
"From 13.0, as we see now, to 16.0, this margin of error is acceptable.",从13.0额到我们现在看到的13.0从到16.0，它能够预测到这个这样的一个错误区间是可以接受的。

"When we have more training data, the prediction results should be better.",等我们训练数据会比较多的话，那么预测推测出来的效果会更好一些。
This is just the first example of our demo.,这只是这是我们要演示的第一个例子。
"If we think broadly, we can not only predict house prices but also  predict other things, for example, stock prices in scenarios like green investing that has gained in popularity in recent years.",我们发散一下思维的话，我们不仅可以预测房价，我们还可以预测一些其他的比如说放在其他场景里面场景下，这几年比较火的一个绿化投资一个股价进行一个预测。
"So, can we predict stock prices using such a model?",那么我们能不能用这样的一个模型对股价进行预测呢？
I believe so.,我觉得这件事也是可以的。
"If you can collect some features affecting stock prices, put them together into a big training dataset and train the model, then we may make predictions on stock prices.",只要你能够收集到影响股价的一些特征，然后把它收集起来做成一做成一个大的数据训练集，然后训练我们的模型，那么我们可以对一些股价进行一些预测。

"There are also objects with low confidence, so in the middle of the process, they were discarded.",还有一些其它置信度比较低的，所以这中间过程中就把它滤掉滤过掉呃滤滤掉了。
"Of course, there are different horse breeds.",当然这个马的话应该有很多种品种。
"For example, there are also different breeds in our training data.",比如说我们训练的数据里面品种也有也有也有很多。

I cannot possibly cause some unnecessary complications to them because our materials are not good enough and our doctors are not up to standard.,我不能因为我们的材料的不好，我们医生的水平不到位，可能给他们造成一些没有必要的并发症。
"If so, the charitable campaign we do may cause exactly opposite effects.",这样以后了，我们的做的这种慈善的活动可能是恰恰相反。
"Therefore, we must really do something and do it best.",所以我们要实实在在地想做点事情，要达到一个最好的水平。
"That's why I am in the position to say that for seven years, I have seen more than 5,000 patients and performed 700 operations.",所以我在任何时候说七年了，看了五千多病人，做了七百个手术。

"Therefore, in our charity tour, we require the donators to personally go there and experience the whole process.",所以在这慈善光明行里面，我们要求捐钱的人必须亲自去，让你去体验整个过程。

"However, they are able to put down their work, put down their senior parents and their children, just to follow there.",但是他们能够放下身边的工作，在这段时间里把自己的老人放下来，把自己的孩子放下来，跟着去。

They said that they have moved themselves in this charity tour.,他们说因为做了这个慈善光明行，感动了自己。
"Doctors may often touch others, but it is rare doctors to be touched by patients.",对医生来说经常会感动别人，但是让病人感动医生是少的。

How can you explain why has a person never been to school at the age of 16?,十六岁没上学怎么能解释呢？
Because she has inverted eye hair.,因为她长的是倒眼毛。

"""Tour of Sight"" may have  just solved a small part of problems related to the shortage of medical care and medicines in the locality, which is just a small fraction of problems and is far from enough.",所以对光明行来说，我们可能到当地可能只是解决了一点缺医少药的一部分，可以说是杯水车薪。

"Many people tell me that today is the engineers' world, for example, giants like Google are dominating the age.",有很多人跟我说今天工程师接管了世界，今天像谷歌这样的公司就是世界的王者。
"But what I want to say is, the age for humanities scolars and students is coming.",但是我想要告诉他们的是，文科生的时代即将来临。
"A free but useless soul, that's what we who graduated from Fudan University always pursue.",一看就是复旦毕业的，自由而无用的灵魂。

"But when we say we are useful, we are actually treating ourselves as a tool.",我们人，作为有用这句话一说出来，你就是工具。
While we always know that man is an end in itself.,但是你说，人，本身是目的。
"Man as an end can never be replaced by machines, which are merely a means to an end.",当你本身是目的的时候你不可取代，因为机器到底它还是一个工具。
Some people may argue that machines also have their own will and thus will rule the world.,有人反对说机器也会有意志，机器未来会统治世界。
That is only human imagination in Hollywood blockbusters.,暂时现在还在好莱坞的片子里，这是我们人类想象的。

We'll set eyes on poetry and the world beyond.,让我们去追寻诗和远方。
What is the world beyond?,什么是远方？

In my house by the sea, warmed by the spring air. """,远方是从明天起做一个幸福的人，喂马、劈柴、周游世界，从明天起关心粮食和蔬菜，我有一所房子，面向大海春暖花开。

"Yesterday, one of my friends phoned me, terrified and scared, saying that one of his relatives, who passed away two years ago, suddenly talked to him on QQ.",昨天呢，我有一个朋友呢，非常惶恐地给我打了一个电话，他说一个离开两年的亲戚，突然在QQ上跟他说话，给他吓个半死。
"He asked me, ""Does he still exist?""",他问我说：“他到底还存在吗？”
"In fact, I also would like to ask this question to every one here today.",其实这个问题我也特别想问给今天我们在座的诸位的每一位朋友们。
"Furthermore, I want to extend this question: Is each of us existing at this moment?",甚至我把这个问题再延伸一下，你们每一个人此时此刻存在吗？
"On what ground, do you believe that you are existing?",你为什么觉得自己是存在？
"Before answering the question, let's play a game.",在回答这样一个问题之前呢，我想我们一起来做一个游戏。
Now is a perfect moment.,现在这是一个很好的时刻。
I hope that you can take this chance to touch the friend sitting beside you.,我希望大家都去触摸一下坐在你旁边的朋友。
"If this friend is the opposite sex who you have a crush on, please seize the chance to touch and feel him or her.",如果这个朋友是你心仪的异性，那你也借此机会接触一下，啊感受一下。
"In fact, this kind of touch we are feeling is the most instinctive method for human being to feel each other's existence before the emergence of electricity.",实际上呢我们正在感受的这样的一种触摸，就是人类在出现电之前，一种最本能的，通过人类的身体接触来感知彼此的存在。
Today's electricity has actually changed all of this.,那今天的电实际上已经彻底地改变这一切。
"Who can imagine that just over a hundred years ago, our human beings often felt each other's presence through a physical contact in this way in the dark moonless night.",谁能想到仅仅在一百多年以前，我们的人类其实还经常在黑暗的，没有月光的夜晚，我们通过这样一种身体的接触来感知彼此的存在。
"Today, the emergence of electricity provides us with more of these methods to perceive the existence, and diversify our forms and content of existence.",而今天电的出现实际上给了我们更多的这种感知存在的这种方式，让我们的存在的形式更多样化了，让我们存在的这样一种内容更丰富了。
"Hence, our existence becomes more stereoscopic.",让我们存在得更立体了。
"For instance, today, you can learn about the latest news of the relatives who are not around you through phone and know that they are at some place by recognizing their voice or through radio waves.",比如说你今天可以通过电话知道不在你身边的亲人，你通过识别他的声音，通过电波你知道你的亲人在某个地方。
"You also know that through the camera you can record where you have been, retain the memory that you once have been to that place and keep the moment that you have been there.",你也知道通过照相机你可以记录你曾经到过的地方，你曾经知道你曾经去过那个地方，你曾经在那一时那一刻存在在那个地方。
"You can also see on TV the existence of friends, acquaintances and strangers in some places at one moment.",你也可以通过电视去看到远方认识或不认识的朋友在某个地方、在某个地点、在某一时刻他在那儿存在。
"Everything that we are getting today and that we are experiencing today comes from electricity, which was beyond imagination over a century ago.",我们今天所有正在获得的一切，正在经历的一切，都是电给我们，而在一百多年前这是不可想象。
"Therefore, these is one question I can answer, with no doubt. You are existing.",所以通过这一点我觉得有一个问题在之前，已经可以毫无悬念的可以回答的就是你们诸位是存在的。
"The reason is that today's cameras and the photos in the cameras of your hands can prove that you are existing at this moment at this place, ""TnDao"".",因为今天的摄像机，你们彼此的你们手中的手机的照相都可以证明，你们这一时这一刻你们存在在这个地点，你们存在在“听道”这个论坛上。
"However, we don't seem to answer the first question.",但是我们似乎并没有回答第一个问题。
"The question, which arouses the suspense, is whether the relative of my friend exists?",这个引起悬念的问题，就是我这个朋友的亲戚，他到底存在不存在？
"How, after the physical body has disappeared for two years, is the relative able to talk to him on QQ?",为什么时隔两年，他的这个物理的躯壳已经离开人世两年，然后他的QQ能够跟他讲话，而且讲了很多都是只有他们亲戚才知道的事情。
We can even further imagine and extend this question.,我们甚至可以把这样的一个问题再进一步地想象一下。
"As his Weibo is still updating and his Facebook homepage is constantly changing, is he still existing?",他的微博还在更新，他的Facebook的主页的状态也在不断地变化，那他到底是不是在存在？
The reason why this question is difficult to answer is that the Internet makes everything perplexing.,之所以这个问题很难回答是因为互联网，因为互联网的存在，将一切的事情扑朔迷离了。
I want to ask every one here today to think about your life one year ago and your life two years ago.,我想想问问我们今天在座的每一位朋友，想想自己过去一年，想想过去两年。
I want to ask you: Who had a Nokia mobile phone three years ago? Please raise your hands.,我想问今天在座的朋友，三年前拥有诺基亚手机的请举手，三年前。
"Then, please raise your hand if you still have a Nokia mobile phone today.",今天还拥有诺基亚手机的请举手。
You can see the results by yourselves.,你们自己可以看看这个结果。
"In this era of rapid Internet evolution, there is no doubt that each of us is spending more time on the Internet.",在这样一个互联网迅速演进的时代，毫无疑问我们每一个人都在花更多的时间在网络上。
"We surf on the Internet, read e-mails, update or browse Weibo, talk with friends on WeChat, communicate with our family and our business partners through other instant messaging tools and watch videos online and go shopping online.",我们在网络上去浏览，我们在看电子邮件，我们在更新微博或者我们在读他人的微博，我们通过微信跟我的朋友沟通，我们通过其他的即时通讯工具跟我们的家人、跟我们的生意上的合作伙伴沟通，我们在网上去看视频，我们在网上去购物。
"When we have these behaviors , as a saying goes, those behaviors are actually an impression on your mindset.",当我们在做这样的一些行为的时候，有一句话在讲，行为其实是你思维的一种印象。
"To some extent, your behaviors are actually printing your mindset in the digital world in this way.",从某种意义上你的行为其实就是在把你的思维打印在这样一个数字的空间。
"That is to say, the digital traces of each of our actions today are actually like a digital printer.",也就是说我们今天的每一个行为所构成的数字痕迹实际上是像有一台数字的打印机。
All of our offline physical behaviors are printed in a digital mirror.,把我们线下的物理的动作在不断地打印在一个数字的镜子里面。
"In this kind of digital mirror, the image of each of us starts to be gathered, accumulated and formed.",在这样一个数字的镜子里面，我们每一个人的印象开始聚集，开始积累，开始形成。
Can such a digital impression completely describe each of us?,今天这样一个数字印象对于我们每个人来讲完整吗？
"Certainly, not.",肯定是不完整。
Can the digital impression exist completely independent of a physical impression?,这样一个数字的印象是不是可以完全独立于一个物理的印象为存在？
"I am afraid not necessarily today, but I believe is that no one can deny one thing that we are all becoming a node.",今天恐怕未必，但是有一点我相信是没有人可以否定的，就是我们都在变成一个节点。
"For instance, before the era of electricity and in the era without light, each of us feels each other's existence through touching bodies.",如果说在没有电之前的时代，我们每个人通过身体的，在没有光亮的时候通过身体的触摸来感知彼此存在。
"In the era of electricity, we extend our perception through a variety of extended electric devices.",如果说在电的时代，我们通过电的各种各样的延伸的设备来延展我们的感知。
"Then, today or even in the future, we will witness the emergence of digital handshake.",那么未来或者说今天正在发生的事，未来我们看到的是一种数字的握手行为。
Each of us will have a digital impression inside a digital mirror.,我们每一个人都会在数字的镜子里面有一个自己的数字的印象。
Your digital impression will greet that of your friends.,这个数字的印象会向你的朋友的数字印象打招呼。
"They will chat, communicate or even trade with each other.",它们之间会沟通，它们之间会交流，它们之间甚至会做交易。
Let's imagine a possible scenario where the digital impression gradually develops as the digital behavior increases.,我们来想象这样的一个可能的场景，就是这个数字的印象在你不断的数字行为之后慢慢丰满起来。
"Gradually, the digital impression can even be independent of the physical existence we see today and own its unique thinking path.",慢慢丰富起来甚至它可以不依赖于我们今天所看到的物理的存在，而单独的有自己的思维的路线。
"Recently, there is a film called Source Code.",最近有一部电影叫这个叫Source code《源代码》。
I don't know how many audience here today have watched it already.,我不知道今天在座的有多少位啊朋友看过。
"In fact, it depicts a mirror image of this kind.",其实它描绘的就是这样一种镜像。
"That is, a person, who has already passed away, still lives in a digital world by some way.",就是一个已经离开人世的人，通过某种方式他依然活在一个数字的世界中。
"Through the digital world, he can communicate with the people he has contacted and the people who are still alive.",他可以通过这样数字的世界，与他曾经接触的人和正在活在世上的人进行沟通。
"Perhaps from this perspective, the relative of my friend still exists.",所以也许从这个角度上来讲，我这个朋友的亲戚也许他还是在存在的。
"As long as there is any digital trace, there may be a seed of life.",只要我们有数字的痕迹存在，就意味着我们有可能有一个生存的种子。
"That is to say, to certain extent, we are all printed to be a source code.",也就是说某种意义上我们都在被打印成一个源代码。
"We are all possible to develop a new self based on the source code, completely different from our physical impression today and evolution path.",我们都有可能基于这样一个源代码发展出一个新的，完全跟我们今天的物理的印象，它的演进路径不一样的另外一个我。
This is a huge change brought about by the internetization and living in a digitalized world.,这个是互联网化带给我们巨大的一个变革，这也是数字化生存带给我们的巨大的变化。
Some may say that today we are experiencing a digital era and living in a society with overloaded information.,有一个人在讲说今天在这样一个数字化的年代，我们是一个信息过载的这样一个社会。
Everyone is terrified. This is a very bad era.,每一个人都很惶恐，这是一个很坏的时代。
"Others may say that today we are living in a very good era, because we can experience unprecedentedly great changes, in our survival, our life and our work, brought by the digitalized world.",有人在说，这是一个非常好的时代，因为我们前所未有的能过去经历这样的一个数字化生存所带给我们的生存、带给我们的生活、带给我们工作方式的巨大的变革。
"Let's imagine if such a digital image can really exist completely independent of our physical existence, then what is it?",我们设想一下如果这样一个数字的影像真正地能够完全独立于我们这样一个物理的存在而存在的话，那它是什么？
"Perhaps there is a phrase for it, that is, ""eternal being"".",也许有一个词组可以来形容它，就叫永远的存在。
Is eternal being equivalent to immortality?,永远的存在是不是永生？
"Over thousands of years, immortality has always been one problem unsolved by human being.",过去千百年来人类从来没有解决的一个难题就是永生的问题。
"First Emperor of Qin attempted to find panaceas for immortality by dispatching children, young men and women, but failed.",秦始皇曾经找了善童善男善女找了很多人想去用灵丹妙药解决永生的问题，没有解决。
"Until today, although mankind has overcome many diseases, but still cannot untangle the problem of immortality.",到今天为止，人类克服了很多疾病，也没有解决这永生的问题。
"Let's think about it. Perhaps, immortality is a problem which cannot be solved by making up for shortcomings.",大家去想一想也许永生的问题的解决根本就不是一个用问题缺陷和弥补的方式。
"Instead, your life can be extended in a completely reconstructed way.",而是一个完全再造的方式去延续你的生命。
"The reason is, theoretically, as a wise creature, the existence of our mindset and brain waves proves our existence to some extent.",因为理论上来讲，作为一种智慧的生物，如果我们的思维我们的脑波存在，其实某种意上我们就在存在。
"Therefore, this era may be a very bad or very good one, but I personally think this is a great one.",所以这可能是一个很坏的时代，这可能也是一个非常好的时代，但我个人认为这是一个伟大的时代。
The reason is that we are fortunate to experience the tremendous changes in our life and work by living in a digitalized world.,因为我们不仅仅有幸去经历这样的一个数字化生存带给我们生活工作巨大的这种改变。
We are fortunate to enjoy the quality life and rich experience brought by this change.,不仅仅有幸可以去享受这种改变带来了的巨大的生活品质和体验的丰富。
"More importantly, we may witness the greatest subversive changes in the history of human existence, or in terms of survival.",更重要的是我们有可能会见证人类生存历史上，或者说生存意义上最大的一次颠覆性的改变。
"Therefore, it can be said that this is a more important era with epochal significance.",所以这是一个更重要的具有时代意义的这样的一个时代。
I think this era is one with the potential for immortality.,而我认为这样的一个时代，是一个有可能永生的时代。
Thank you!,谢谢！
"In 2015, I brought my little girl, a typical generation Z, to her first cross-country half marathon.",2015年我带着我的女儿啊，这个一个标准的零零后的小孩啊，这个呃完成了她自己第一个呃越野的半程马拉松啊。
"She was also the youngest runner in this extreme endurance challenge, which gathered contestants from across the world irrespective of their ethnicity or nationality.",她也是这个全世界参与这项这个极限挑战赛里面最小的选手，啊无论人种，无论国家。
There were two things I did in 2015 that made me proud.,2015年我干了两件让我自己觉得对自己很满意的事情。
The first thing was that I put my kid through an uncommon challenge.,啊一件事情，就是让这个孩子呃经历了一次难得的人生的挑战。
And I'll talk about my motivation in the latter part of this speech.,啊后面会谈到我为什么要做这样的选择。
The second thing was that I had my identity changed in 2015.,第二件事情，在2015年我改变了自己的身份。
"I quit as a manager, also a senior executive with 12 years of working experience, in a listed company.",呃结束了呃23年的上市公司呃管理人员，特别是十二年企业高管的这样身份。
Then I joined the entrepreneurship wave and founded my own business.,啊跟刚才的韦予她们一样，加入了滚滚的这个创业大潮里面，成为了一名创业者。
And I'd attribute the two interesting moves I made in 2015 to a very unusual research report I finished between 2012 and 2014.,那么之所以会在15年做了这么两个很有意思的事情，我觉得是跟我2012年到2014年啊完成的呃一个非常奇特的调研报告有关系。
"During the two years, I found a whole new world unfolding before me.",啊这样的两年里头，让我经历了一次非常不一样的心路历程。
Today I'd like to take this precious opportunity to share something in the report with you.,这今天在这儿呢，想跟大家利用一个很难得的机会，分享一下这个一个报告的一些内容。
"What the report presented jolted me into new thoughts about my future, our children's future, and our nation and country's future.",它使得我对我自己的未来，对于这一代孩子的未来，以及这个民族和国家的未来产生了非常震撼性的思考。
"The research, unpublished, was entrusted to us by a central department.",这个调研是啊受这个中央某部委的委托。
"It lasted one year and a half, and involved seven doctors and post-doctors from seven different sectors.",啊，这个我们长达一年半，七个来自不同领域的七个博士跟博士后，我们做了一个封闭性的研究。
"And it's comforting to know that, two of our suggestions in the report were adopted and implemented by the government to deal with different issues in a different way.",嗯当然非常欣慰的是这个研究最后的结果，呃两项我们的建议都被国家在用不同的这个场合在不同的方式下进行了采纳。
"First, they have largely helped improve China's birth control policies.",啊一个就是大力地改良了中国的生育政策。
"Second, they have boosted the momentum of entrepreneurship and innovation.",第二，就是大力地推动了全民的创业和创新。
"Actually when we finished the report, we didn't expect so many changes would occur in policy-making in no more than one year.",但我们做完这个报告的时候，并没有预料到后来会在不到一年的时间里头发生了这么多政策的变化。
That was a great comfort for the seven of us researchers.,啊这当然也是我们七位参与调研的人的无比的欣慰的事的事情。
"But numbers, appalling numbers, are my focus today.",那今天更想分享的是这个调研里面一大堆骇人听闻的数字。
Our research was first launched because of the sixth national census in 2010.,我们之所以有这样一个研究，啊起始于2010年的第六次国家人口普查。
This census presented some troubling figures that would haunt my mind and remind me of how terrible a situation our kids would be stuck in when they are at my age.,这个第六次人口普查里面有一组数字，啊经常在我的脑子里面经常闪经常闪现，这些数字时常让我看着我的孩子们，想着他们到我这个年纪的时候，他们面临的国家和面临的未来。
"According to the figures, the post-80s in China amounted to 228 million, while the post-90s and the generation Z respectively totaled 171 million and 122 million.",这组数字里显示的情况是这样的啊，我们看见的三个decade三个十年的人口，这个80后的总人口是2.28亿，90后的总人口是1.71亿，00后的总人口是1.22亿。
There was a 20% to 30% decrease per decade in the number of the newborns.,平均以呃20%多到30%的速度每个decade在递减着。
"Such rapid decrease is very rare or even unprecedented in the world, especially in countries with a massive population",这样的递减速度，在全世界的特别是人口大国里，几乎是非常罕见而且说是绝无仅有。
"Against this dismal background, we conducted a one-year-and-a-half-long research about the changes seen in China's demographic structure, labor force quality and efficiency.",那么基于这样的一个非常严峻的现实，啊我们历时一年半做了一项非常特别的研究，就是中国的人口结构的变迁，劳动力素质的变迁和生产效率的变迁。
We also touched on the topic of where China will be going in the following 30 years.,以及中国未来30年的国家发展趋势的探讨。
Now I'd like to share some of the results with you.,这个探讨过程之中，啊有一些数目字今天跟大家在这做个分享。
"The first thing is that China's demographic structures, including that of its newborns, are managed with artificial efforts.",首先的是我们国家的人口的这个结构啊，实际上包括出生结构是人为造成的。
"Under artificial birth control, there might be birth peaks, or even bans on giving birth to children.",啊我们就有有这个人为的生育高峰，啊有人为的不让生育啊，这是非常人人为计划性的这个这个出生的这种规律。
This artificial birth control results in a fluctuating population with several peaks.,实际上它带来了我们的人口的峰值啊是这个忽上忽下而且是一一个一个的这个鼓包来产生的这样的人口的发展规律。
"From 1966 to 1974, over 300 million new babies were born.",那么我们看到1966年到1974年，我们出生了将近三个亿的人口。
"Among whom I myself was a member. The years 1968, 1969 and 1970 saw the first population peak.",啊我本人就是这其中之一啊，我是这个第一次人口高峰中高峰的高峰，呃我们是出生在1968、69、70的，这个高峰的人口。
The 310 million new population was to become the major source of China's large production and consumption dividends during the first three decades of its reform and opening-up.,这3.1亿的人口，也是今天我们说中国改革开放第一个三十年给中国改革开放，无论是产生了大量的生产红利还是消费红利的主要的来源。
"The second population peak occurred between 1985 and 1996, with 180 million new babies born, out of the previous baby boomer generation, as you can guess.",第二个人口高峰发生在1985年到1996年，这个高峰出生了1.8亿人口，啊这1.8亿人口的高峰就是前面那高峰生出来的大家都能理解，啊。
When will the third population peak come then?,第三个高峰在什么时候呢？
"It might come when the generation Z becomes parents, and it might produce a population of only 94 million. That is hardly 100 million.",第三个高峰大约连一个亿都没有，啊只有0.94亿，大概是在00后我女儿她们再往后的一批人里。
"Let's forget about the third peak, and just focus on the first two peaks.",那个高峰几乎不用去期待，啊我们就看这两个高峰。
And by inferring from these two peaks we got some very exact numbers.,看到这两个高峰以后，我们又做了一个非常准确的数字推演。
There will be a sharp decline of effective labor force from 2030 to 2033.,那就是到2030年到2033年间，我们的有效劳动力将发生一次重大的衰减。
"That's to say, we baby boomers born between 1966 and 1974 will all have to withdraw from workplace, by retiring at 60 years old.",也就是说我们这3.1亿的1966到1974出生的人将全部撤出阵地啊，当然我们是以60岁退休来画的这条线。
But of course there is a big chance that our retirement will be delayed.,当然也许有人会说，啊六十岁不让你退休。
"Right, we'll then have to work a few more years.",是吧，咱们还得再多干几年。
"The truth is, retirement can be delayed due to shortage of pensions, but the delay does do no actual good to the entire society.",但是我想跟各位讲，让你退休与不让你退休，那是养老金的问题，那无益于社会的真实的贡献。
"Let's calculate, if at 60 years old, around year 2033, we, the entire 310 million population, withdraw from workplace, then what kind of society shall we face?",那么我们还是按六十岁来算的话，那么到2033年前后我们这3.1亿人口将全部撤出阵地，到时候面临一个什么样的数目字呢？
"In 2033, or at the latest in 2034, we'll have to let 700 million people provide for another 700 million people.",也就是到2033年，最迟到2034年左右，我们将面临着一个七亿人养活七亿人的国家。
How do we know that?,七亿人养活七亿人这个数字怎么来的？
"Around 2033, there will be some 440 million over-60-year-olds, and 240 million people that must be taken care of, including the 90 million-plus disabled and 100 million-plus minors.",到2033年左右，我们将有4.4亿左右的六十岁以上人口，还有2.4亿的必须的被抚养人口，这里面包括了将近九千多万的残疾人，还有一点多亿的那个时候的未成年人。
That brings the total number of dependents to about 680 million.,那么简单的算一下大约6.8亿人。
"According to predictions, China's population base of 1400 million might hardly increase in future.",按照14亿人口基数很难再增长的这样一个预测。
"Hence basically we can infer that the dependency ratio of China might reach 1:1(700 million feeding another 700 million), a standard indicator in demography.",那么我们基本上可以看到在那个时间中国将进入一个在人口学上标准的七亿人抚养七亿人的人口抚养比1:1的国家。
This dependency ratio is also of significance for the study of demographic structures and production.,人口抚养比1:1，这在人口的结构和生产力的研究上，这是一个重要的节点。
"For example, the Gini coefficient of a country we frequently mention may indicate the production, creative and innovative capability and the burden of a nation, a ethnic group, a country or a certain population.",啊就像我们经常在讨论的基尼系数啊等等这样的数目字啊，它背后标志着这样的一个族群、民族、国家、群体，它的生产力、创造力、创新能力以及他的国家负担等等。
We compared China with 54 countries which have also experienced a 1:1 dependency ration.,那么这样的一个状态，我们对标了世界上的54个已经遭遇了人口抚养比一比一的国家。
So what did we learn?,大约都是什么情况呢？
Over twenty of the developed countries are basically suffering a drastic decline in their economic and GDP growth.,发达国家，我们研究了大约二十几个，这些国家基本上我们所说的经济增长、GDP增长等等等等都急剧的下滑，啊增长率极低。
"The growth rate could be extremely low for decades, and sometimes it might verge on zero.",几十年增长率都很低，甚至于趋近于零。
"Some of the developing countries achieved the 1:1 dependency ratio even before they got rich, and now they all, with no exception, fall into the middle-income trap.",发展中国家，也有一些国家在还没有富裕的时候就进入了这个人口抚养比一比一，大约这些国家几乎无一例外的全部掉进了中等收入陷阱。
"But the bigger problem for us is that, all the countries we compared with China only have a population of tens of millions.",但是给我们更加震撼的问题是，所有我们对标的国家，人口都是千万级的，都是几千万人级别。
"Even though their dependency ratio is 1:1, it only means tens of millions will provide for another group of tens of millions.",那就意味着即便是1:1，也是几千万人抚养几千万人的问题。
But here in China we'll let 700 million people feed another 700 million people.,那么我们是个七亿人抚养七亿人的问题。
We have no historical experience in that.,这在人类历史上，闻所未闻，没有先例可以可以探讨和对标。
Only one country of all with a 1:1 dependency ratio bears some resemblance to China and thus might provide a useful reference for China.,所以我们在整个这些1:1的国家的里面我们找到了一个勉强跟中国可以对标的国家。
It is Japan.,就是日本。
For over 20 years Japan's dependency ratio remained 1:1.,日本是一个人口抚养比经历了20多年1:1。
It's also an aging country whose economy has been stagnant for more than 20 years.,经济停滞二十多年的一个人口抚养比越过1:1的老龄化国家。
Its population has surpassed 100 million.,那么它也是人口过亿的国家。
"That means, about 50 million Japanese people have to feed another 50 million Japanese people.",啊大概的五千多万对五千多万。
"OK, but I guess, compared with Japan, our burden is far more formidable.",那么OK，拿日本作为研究的话，我们觉得到那时我们七亿人对七亿人，可能负担更为可怕。
And there is something even more terrible.,但是更加可怕的还不是这些。
"When we were doing our research, we pored over Japan's population data and studied all the patterns its economic growth had assumed.",在做这个研究的时候，我们翻阅了日本的人口数据，日本的经济增长的所有的规律。
And we found that it took Japan only 20 years or so to shift from a fast-growing economy which made the best use of young population to an aging country.,我们在找到他们的这个整个的从他们的经济快速成长，年轻人口的高效利用，到他们变成老龄化国家，前后一共经历了20来年的时间。
It was a short cycle indeed.,周期很短。
"When Japan entered the aging period between 1992 and 1993, when it declared that its dependency ratio had almost reached 1:1, 65 percent of its GDP was being propelled by its ability to transform the scientific and technological achievements into economic growth.",那么当他们进入到老龄化国家的时候，在他们的1992到1993年，他们宣布人口抚养比接近1:1的时候，这个国家的GDP拉动因素里面，65%来自于科技转化的能力。
"Some of us here today perhaps understand how the economy, or macro-economy, works. And you might have noticed that though Japan has sunk into an economic stagnation, the standard of living of its people is not sacrificed.",这里面在座的很多人其实可能也研究经济学研究这个呃宏观经济等等，大家可能有人观察到，日本这么些年来虽然经济停滞，但日本老百姓的生活质量并没有下降。
"On my way up here just now I took a close look at the camcorders and cameras there in the back, and found that almost all our filming and photographing tools here are made in Japan.",今天我刚才进来的时候我仔细看看了一下，我们背后的摄像机、照相机，我们现场有人拿的一些摄影摄像设备几乎全是日本产品。
"And Japanese cars, undaunted by their US rivals, still dominate the US automobile market.",到今天日本的汽车，还没有被美国的汽车翻过身来，啊仍然占领着美国的汽车市场。
That is Japan. A severely aging country whose economy has been in stagnation for over twenty years.,就是这样一个国家已经经济停滞了二十多年，而他们的老龄化程度非常的严重。
But what happens to China today?,那么我们今天的中国怎么样了？
"Using Japan as a reference, we've found something threatening.",我们对标了自己，我们看见一个非常可怕的现象。
"When Japan's dependency ratio hit 1:1, 65 percent of its GDP was boosted by its ability to transform the scientific and technological achievements.",日本在人口抚养比1:1进入老龄化的年代，它的GDP拉动因素65%来自科技转化能力。
"But in today's China, among the top ten GDP drivers, which propel over 60% of its GDP, almost none is related to such a transforming ability.",而我们今天的GDP拉动因素里面，占前十位的，也就是拉动力超过60%的能力的这些行业跟科技转化转化成为的经济增长几乎没有关系，几乎没有关系。
"As we, especially I, can see, the No. 1 economic driver in China is something I've worked in for over twenty years: the real estate industry.",我们大家都很清楚特别是我特别清楚，啊我们的整个经济拉动能力的第一位的增长能力来自于原来我从事了二十多年的行业：房地产行业。
"But in some sense, this industry is consuming land and resources without producing future benefits.",但某种意义上说，这样的一个行业消耗土地、消耗资源、不产生未来的一个行业。
It is actually kidnapping China's economic development.,在绑架着一个大国经济的发展。
Such comparisons about numbers and the economic structure left us in a panic.,在这样一个过程里面我们对比了这样的一组数字，以及经济结构的对比，实际上，让我们产生了非常恐慌的感觉。
"There are only 15, or at most 18 years left for us before the dependency ratio hits 1:1.",如果说我们仅有15年的时间，到最多18年的时的时间我们将面临人口抚养比1:1的状态的时候。
"It will be a big challenge for us to, within this period, truly transform the economic structure and let science and technologies lead the economic development.",我们能不能在这样15年到18年的时间里边，真正地把中国的经济结构转化成为科技拉动和技术引领，这个是摆在我们面前一道严峻的课题。
Why must we complete the transformation within the 15 years?,为什么要在这15年里转化？
Why does our window only last 10 to 15 years?,为什么我们的窗口期仅仅只有10年到15年？
That is decided by the creativity of our entire population.,这跟我们的整个人口创造能力是有关系的。
"A Harvard study about the population creativity of different countries revealed that, all the discoverers, inventors and promoters of the important inventions, innovations and the guiding sciences and technologies are young people aged from 20 to 40, 25 to 40 being their golden time.",我们看了这个哈佛大学包括各个国家对于人口创造能力的研究报告里面，可以发现其实所有的重要的发明创新以及引领性的科技和技术，他们所有的发现人、发明者和推动者，基本上他们的年龄层次都是在20岁到40岁之间，最黄金的时段是在25到40岁。
"But when a country, like China, is suffering a drastic decline in the young population, how can we be sure that, when it reaches the dismal 1:1 dependency ratio, it will have enough creativity?",当一个国家的年轻人口急剧衰减的时候，我们谈何敢去期待，在我们人口抚养比1:1的时候，在这么一个严峻的时间点上，我们还能有那么强大的创新跟创造能力呢？
That's what alarmed us when we finished our report.,这是我们做完这个报告的时候，让我们觉得非常恐怖的一件事情。
And there is something even more terrible that that.,当然还有一个更可怕的事情。
"When we were studying the 700 million bread-earners, we set up another indicator that measured their valid ability to feed the 700 million dependents.",在研究那个抚养人的那个七亿人的时候，我们又做了一个呃参考因素，啊我们再算了一下说这个抚养人的这七亿人的有效抚养能力到底有多少。
"The seven of us, who specialized in seven different fields, spent three to four months in analyzing the data and finally came up with our respective answer.",啊我们我们这七个不同专业的这个研究者呃我们花了大概三四个月的时间调研了很多数据，我们每一个人给出了自己答案。
The figures were terribly grim.,这个答案给出来的时候其实非常恐怖啊。
The lowest rate of valid feeding was 30%.,呃这个我们这七个人里面最低的那个人说有效率只有30％。
What does that mean?,你们知道这有效率30%意味着什么？
It means 200 million people will have to provide for another 1200 million people.,意味着说我们只有两个多亿的人要去抚养12亿的人。
The figure 30 percent almost rendered us speechless.,我们看见这个30的数字的时候我们对这个人我们几乎就无语了。
"We complained to its submitter that if such a figure became true, then there might be no point doing the research.",说这个说你拿出这样的数字我们还研究这种事儿还有什么用。
Maybe we'll just leave things to fate.,我们基本上可以可以投降了，啊。
"The highest result was 70 percent, which means there would be 500 million bread-earners.",最高的人当时说是70％，也就是5个亿啊。
"Now I'll give you a chance to guess, that person who said 30 percent, which sector did he come from? The seven of us came from seven different sectors that are: science, education, industry, internet, finance, medical care and national defense.",我问问大家能不能猜到，那我们那个七个人啊来自于什么科技、教育、啊产业、互联网的啊、金融、呃医疗啊等等的、国防啊七个领域吧，你们猜这说30％那个人是从哪个哪个领域来的。
"I don't mean to offend anyone here, but he worked in education.",我在交大说这句话不怕得罪学校，来自教育。
"So we asked this post-doctor in education, ""Why are you so sure that only 200 million of the 700 million bread-earners will be useful?""",我们就问这个教育界的这个博士后，说你凭什么说，这七亿人里边只有两个多亿是有用的呢？
"And he explained to us, ""500 million of the 700 million have been born, but you should know that those 500 million people also include children from the poor regions, migrant workers' children, left-behind children, abducted children and criminals' children. blah blah blah...""","他说你看啊,这些七个七亿个人有五个亿人已经出生了啊，这五个亿的人，这里面包括老少边穷、打工子弟、留守儿童、拐卖儿童、服刑人员子女、balabalabala一大堆。"
"""How can those people be counted on to feed other people?""",他说这些人当他们长大的时候，你期待他能抚养你吧？
"He insisted, ""It will be pretty great that they can feed themselves.""",他能把自己抚养了都不错了。
But we disagreed with his overgeneralization.,那我们说这些我们也想了。
We thought 40 percent might be a more reasonable figure.,那也就是40%吧，那不能说70％都都是这个。
"Though we dismissed the figure 30 percent as being ill-founded, we accepted the figure 70 percent as something quite probable.",我们不论是70还是30啊，我们30我们认为是不应该去听他的，但是我认为70一点都不吓人。
"What will that be like, when 500 million people have to feed another 900 million people?",那是什么局面呢？那将是一个五亿人养活九亿人的局面？
Do you know how many people today are earning bread for others in today's China?,大家知道今天的中国，我们是多少人养活多少人吗？
"We've already known from Premier Li Keqiang's government work report that, in today's China, 900 million people are providing for another 500 million people.",如果有人这次认真听了李克强总理的政府工作报告，他专门点了这个数字，今天的中国恰恰是九亿人在养活五亿人的局面。
"But in 15 or 18 years, the situation will be reversed: 500 million will have to feed another 900 million.",我们再过15年到18年，就面临着一个五亿人要养活九亿人的局面。这个天平的倒反。
That's really a terrible thing.,将是非常非常令人恐惧的。
"One day in the summer of 2014, when I'd just finished the research report, I went back home and found my daughter doing her homework.",我研究完这个报告的时候啊，我当时是在2014年的夏天，我回家有一天哎呀就看着我女儿在做作业。
Then I couldn't help wondering how the figures in my report would have anything to do with her.,我就在算这这组这组数跟她有什么关系。
"She will turn 30 in 15 years, around 2030, exactly the time when she will have to face a country with a 1:1 dependency ratio.",这孩子30岁的时候，恰恰是在15年也就2030年前后的时候，她们正好面对着一个抚养比一比一的中国。
I mentioned earlier in my speech that 180 million babies were born between1985 and 1996.,刚才我提到1985到1996年的1.8亿人口。
These 180 million people I wish you could really pay attention to.,这1.8亿人口大家要引起高度的重视。
"Speakers like Wei Yu just now, belongs to this 180 million people.",啊刚才的韦予她们都在这1.8亿人口里面。
"They are now in their prime time, aged from 20 to 30 years old.",这1.8亿人口今天正处在30岁到20多岁的这样一个黄金的年龄段里。
"And they are fighting together with us post-60s, all the post-70s and some post-80s.",伴随着他们的还有我们这一批60后、全部的七零后和八零后。
"Now is the best time for China's labor force, and only ten golden years of it are left.",这是今天劳动力人口最优秀的时间点，也就是最后的十年。
"Once the ten years pass, much more burden will be placed on the shoulder of the labor force.",这十年过去，他们就要扛起所有的重担。
"So, if within the next ten years, the 180 million young people could fully engage in the transformation of Chinese economic structure and truly propel scientific innovation and technological development, then they might help China successfully get through the population crisis that's to come in 15 to 18 years.",所以这十年里如果能够让这1.8亿的年轻人口彻底地从事跟参与到中国的经济发展方式的转型里边，他们能够真正地推动科技创新、技术引领，那么标志着中国在15年到18年之后的面临的严峻的人口拐点的时候，也许他们能够真正的起到中国转型的中流砥柱的作用。
"When I was preparing my speech, the organizer asked me what topic I would choose.",所以我在来这场论坛前，呃组织者问我讲讲什么。
I said I'd like to talk about the education of children.,我说我讲讲怎么教育孩子。
"But most importantly, I wanted to tell the next generation of young people that whatever they do, they must strengthen their sense of innovation and competition, and always hone their sword, for they have no choice.",但更多的我想讲讲对于下一代的年轻人，他们无论是不是要运动式的创业和创新，但他们的创新意识跟竞争意识以及搏斗的能力必须要加强，他们没有选择。
"To sum up, I think those alarming figures indicate the beginning of a worst era for human beings, but they can also herald a best era in which we might feel lucky to live.",所以总结一下，我想说骇人听闻的数字给了我一个让我觉得这是个最坏的时代的开始的话，我也看到了一个人类最好时代的开始，这也是我们平生非常有幸的一个时代。
"We might have never imagined that we will one day step into a great but unpredictable age of transformation full of uncertainties, and we are also facing harsh challenges.",我们从来都不能想象，我们经历了也正在迈入人类社会一个伟大的而且今天难以预料的充满了不确定跟变革的新的时代的开始，而恰恰这个时候中国又面临着如此严峻的挑战。
So what shall we do in such a transitional period?,所以在这样的一个风云会际的时候，如何给下一代人一个交代？
"What legacy can we leave to our offspring, and how shall we respond to the call of the age?",如何给这个时代一个回应？
"Shall we choose to be abandoned by time, or shall we just plunge into the tide of great transformation?",到底是选择被这个时代抛弃还是参与到这场伟大的变革里边？
This is an age where we can make a difference.,这是一个能够让你活出不一样的时代。
Let's work together for a happy ending.,让我们都对自己有一个美好的交代。
Thank you.,好，谢谢大家。
Let’s start with this picture.,我们就先从这么一张照片开始。

"As we sometimes occupied the elevator, discontent spread among several neighbors.",因为有些时候偶尔会占用一下这个电梯资源嘛，惹得一部分居民不高兴。
"What’s worse, they insisted on complaining and even reporting to the administration for industry and commerce.",不高兴就算了，非去投诉我们，还去举报。
That was not the worst.,你举报就举报嘛，你干嘛要不说真话。
"They also fabricated the rumor that, “Something happened in our community! A very serious problem! Hundreds of people engaged in illegal training here!”",他跟工商讲说：“我们小区出事儿了，出大事儿，几百号人，在我们小区里头搞非法培训！”
Oh my goodness!,哇！
"Owing to this, officials in the department were highly eager to get into action since they hadn’t met such a major case.",弄的所里头的同事们是摩拳擦掌、跃跃欲试，从来没有见过这么大的case诶。
"One day, the head of the department personally led a crowd of officials and rushed to our office.",有一天，所长亲自带队，一大帮子人就冲到了我们的办公室里头来啊。
"At that time, I still had a meeting with my customer elsewhere.",当时我还在外面见客户。
"Afterwards, I heard from my colleagues that a group of people stormed in, who were all dressed in uniform and amounted to a dozen or so.",后来我听我同事讲，那一伙人气势汹汹地冲进来，都穿制服的，足有十来号。
"It is surprising that they came in without a single word, just looked around and took photos, and finally left quietly.",结果这帮人进来之后我是一言不发，还转了好几圈好几圈，还拍了些照片儿，走的时候还静悄悄得。
A huge puzzle for us.,很纳闷，没搞明白是怎么回事儿。
"After that, the department frequently contacted me, asking me to have a face-to-face talk with the head in the office.",后来这所里头就一直联系我，说要约我，到所里面谈，而且还要跟所长单独谈。

Listen to me, young minds think alike, I am on your side.”",结果没想到他说：“我跟你讲哦，如果我没猜错的话，我进你的办公室，第一感是这就是美国的苹果、Google一开始在车库里头创业的感觉，我告诉你，我也是年轻人我懂的。”
"Dramatically, right?",噢呀，180度大转弯？
The thrill was beyond description and I asked: “ Do you mean no punishment then?”,我那个激动啊，我说：“所长那你的意思就是不罚啦？”
"He completely ignored my question and continued, “Believe me, I have seen many enterprises, but few can be on a par with yours. The community will restrict your development and there must be many industrial parks which are eager to let you in. If you rent a new place and get ready to move, let me know and then it’s settled, OK?”",他完全无视我，他继续说：“我给你讲哦，你要相信我，我见过企业多了，像你这样的不多见的，你这种企业再呆在小区里头你是浪费生命，赶紧出去，不知道多少家园区要抢着要你，等你把房子租好啦，自己要搬走啦，给我打声招呼，咱这事儿把它了了好不好？”
Thanks to unexpected good fortune that got me out of the trouble.,出门遇贵人啊，就这么着化险为夷了一次。

"To be frank, at the beginning of my entrepreneurship, I was an ordinary college graduate, the most ordinary one.",老实讲在我创业之初，就是一个最普通、最平凡的大学生。
"Here, this picture shows in 2005, how I, a post-graduate who just left college and decided to start a business, looked like.",你们可以看这张照片，这是2005年我研究生刚毕业那一会儿，决定要创业之前的一个状态。

It’s a natural thing since I always went to bed at 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning after 14 hours of work time every day.,没办法，创业嘛，每天晚上3、4点钟睡觉是很正常的事情，工作一天十四个小时是家常便饭。

True words sometimes.,有些时候是真的是这个样子。
"At that time, thick hair was not my only “advantage”, but more importantly, I was full of vigour and enthusiasm.",但是呢那个时候啊，我不是光是头发茂密，更关键的是精力旺盛。
"I was fond of the Internet and firmly believed that it was the key to change everything, including future education in China.",啊，就是喜欢互联网，坚持认为互联网可以改变一切，包括未来中国的教育。
"To this end, I started Hujiang, an online learning platform at a very early time.",所以我很早就办了这个沪江网。
"To be more specific, since my junior year in college in 2001, Hujiang was founded and open to the public free of charge afterwards.",大学三年级2001年的时候，我就把这个网站办出来，之后一直是免费公益的状态在运营着。

"In fact, the true meaning was shared simply among our team members.",其实我们知道。
"As we had a difficult start and for a long time, he was generally the only one programming engineer, or abbreviated as “general engineer”.",因为创业之初嘛困难，很长一段时间总是只有他这么一个程序员，嘿嘿，简称“总程”。
Now here is another picture.,我们再看这个哈。
"It was the first gathering before starting our business, in which I invited all the people who helped me free of charge during those five years.",这是创业前的我们一次聚首，我把五年当中一直免费这公益的帮助过我的兄弟姐妹们就叫了一块儿。
"I said, “I’ve decided to start a formal company and now we can own the shares together. But all of you should first finish a task, that is, to borrow money separately!”",我说：“我决定要成立公司，正儿八经干了哦。我做一个决定，把新公司的股份分给你们，你们所有的人，要完成新公司的第一个任务，干嘛？回家去分头借钱！”
I had same task as well.,我也回家去了。
"However, though I borrowed from all acquaintances, more money was necessary.",我回到家把我们家的钱全都借完了，还不够。
"Then back to Shanghai, I turned to an intimate classmate during college and asked him to borrow me 20,000 yuan.",又返回上海，找到了大学的一个同学一个哥们儿，我就跟他讲，我说：“你有没有2万块钱？”
"He looked at me and answered, “No.”",他看着我说：“没有。”
I was downhearted accordingly.,心里头拔凉拔凉。
Actually I had made full mental preparations in case of failure to borrow more money.,尽管我来之前做了十足的心理准备，估计是借不着钱。
"Naturally, a new graduate from college may barely earn his living, let alone to save 20,000 yuan that was available to support your new business with an ambiguous future .",因为大家想想看嘛，刚毕业的大学生，养活自己也不容易，还得为你攒出2万块钱，去干创业那时候那么不靠谱的事儿。
"Though I didn’t hold much hope, I was then overcome by sorrow.",所以其实我是有这个这个心理准备的，但是心里还是止不住难过。
Why?,为什么呢？
"Because I had no methods towards more money, neither vc nor angel investors.",因为我没有其他的来钱的办法，我也不认识什么vc，也不知道什么天使。
"In other words, angel investors didn’t know me either.",天使也不认识我对吧。
"Fortunately, as I was at a loss what to do and depressed at losing the last straw, he looked straight at me, and added several words: “But my father has money!”",这个所以，正在我一筹莫展的时候，为这最后一根稻草失去而难过的时候，这兄弟又两眼睛直勾勾地看着我他说：“但是我爸有！”
I didn’t even know how he managed to persuade his father.,我最后都不知道他是怎么从他老爸手里头把两万块钱给kiang出来。
"The funny thing afterwards was that he held the money tight and I wanted to take it, so the money moved back and forth between us for several times.",然后给我的时候啊我们拽来拽去，拽来拽去。
"I said, “What are you doing? Do you regret?”",我说：“你啥意思？你后悔不给我了？”
"He replied, “No, no, no. The last question, OK? Can we give up now?”",他说：“不不不不不，我再最后问你一个问题，”什么问题呢？“咱能不能不创业？ ”
"“Ridiculous! If I quit now, why do I borrow your money?”",“去！不创业我问你借钱干嘛？”
"He explained, “OK, listen to me. You, Fu Cairui, is not the last among classmates. Why not choose other careers? Is starting a business a must? How can you make profit?”",他说：“你看哦，付彩瑞你这个人在同学里头你是不痴不笨不呆不傻，你干什么不行？干嘛非得去创业？我问你啊，你怎么赚钱？”
"Then I said, “Mm... I don’t know.”",我说：“我不知道。”
"At that time, I didn't think too much of it as I had already made up my mind to start a business.",当时也容不得我去想，我一定要走上创业这条道儿。
"Unexpectedly, I finally got the money.",就这么着这钱他竟然给我借过来了。
"Therefore, we can conclude that we surely need partners and friends, especially when you are in trouble, or just start a business.",所以人有时候真的是特别需要伴儿需要朋友，尤其是在你困难的时候，在你创业的时候。
"Owing to the money, at last, 8 members were equipped with 8 swivel chairs and in the aforementioned housing estate, started with 80,000 yuan.",有了这些钱啊，我们终于可以八个人八张转椅，在刚刚那个小区里头靠着这8万块钱就正式起家了。
Then how about others apart from the original 8 members?,这里头超过八个的人头都是谁呢？
"They were all boyfriends or girlfriends of these 8 ones, or their relatives.",都是其他八个人的额男女朋友，或者是亲人亲属。
"There’s a saying goes, “If one person starts a business, the whole family will suffer”.",有句话这么讲嘛，叫“一人创业，全家受罪”。
Look！,你看！
"Luckily, we did better in the second year.",还好我们第二年就这个样子了。
"Following photos were taken in the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, finally the six and a half years, now.",第二年，这个第三年对吧，啊第四年、第五年、第六年、六年半、now现在。
"For a long time since our start, if I am to sum up, the greatest experience is that, if you want to go fast, go on your own.",创业这么长时间以来，如果你让我去总结的话，我最大的感受是：如果你要想走得快，一个人上路。
Because nobody will disagree with you and you can just follow your own heart.,因为没有人管你，爱咋地咋地。
"But if you want to go far, go along with partners.",但如果你要想走得远，结伴而行。
"Furthermore, if you want to go far and steady, multiply your partners.",如果你要想走得又远又扎实，成群结队。
Sometimes I would like to compare starting a new business with the journey to the west.,所以有些时候我总是感觉，创业就像是西天取经。
"Tang Monk had never imagined to go along with a monkey(Sun Wukong) and a pig(Zhu Bajie), nor all sorts of monsters and astonishing experience.",唐僧在一开始压根就不知道，他会跟猴子、猪为伴，他也不知道他会碰到多少乱七八糟的妖怪和多少意想不到的事儿。
"But the process is still so fascinating and exciting that it makes you feel like you can change the world, or you have changed the world to what extent.",但是创业这个过程，还是那么令人着迷，很兴奋，让你感觉到你可以改变全世界，或者你把全世界给改变到了什么样的程度。
"In conclusion, if entrepreneurship is a journey, destination is naturally important, but it is more crucial to set out with those like-minded.",所以要我说，如果创业就是一趟旅程的话，终点固然重要，但是能够和自己志同道合的同伴们一块启程，更重要。

I think anyone who sees such a result will be excited.,我想任何一个人看到这么一个结果。
I still feel very excited even now.,也会是非常激动的，我就是现在仍然非常激动。
"From this story, I believe, we may learn a lot of useful lessons.",我想从这个故事里边，我们也许可以得到很多有益的启示。
"Someone once asked me, you have been the president of three different universities, namely, Shanghai Normal University, East China Normal University and currently New York University Shanghai, and in your view, what is the most important job of a president?",有人曾问我你当过上师大、华师大，现在是上海纽约大学三所不同类型的校长，你觉得什么是校长最重要的工作？

"However, if I’m allowed to summarize the work of a university president with the most concise words, I will say two words, think and communicate.",但是如果，要让我用最简洁的词语来概括大学校长的工作，我会说两个词，思考、沟通。
"There are several traditional means of communication, including convening meetings, to convey spirits and arrange tasks, which is a top-down way of communication; organizing symposiums and consultation meetings, which is a bottom-up way of communication; and having heart-to-heart talks to encourage democratic activities, which is interactive communication.",我们有很多沟通的传统的办法，开大会，传达精神，布置任务，这是自上而下的沟通；开座谈会、恳谈会、咨询会，这是自下而上的沟通；民主生活，促膝谈心，这是互动式的沟通。
It is my hope to establish a bridge for communication between the university and students.,我希望能够建立和学生之间沟通的渠道。
"I recall that ten years ago, when I was the president of Shanghai Normal University, we would hire a group of students each year as assistants to president.",记得十年前，我还是上海师大的校长，我们每年都会聘请一批学生作为我们的校长助理。
"We hope through these assistants, we can build a bridge for communication between the university and the students to facilitate mutual understanding and communication.",希望通过我们这些助理，来搭建学校和学生之间的沟通的桥梁，使相互之间能够有更多的了解和沟通。

"In 2006, I returned to East China Normal University to serve as the president.",2006年我回到华师大担任校长。
A well-meaning student signed up on the Renren.com with my real name and a cartoon avatar of me which was quite handsome.,有一个好心的学生用我的实名在人人网上注册，他代表我，还用了我的头像，一张漫画的头像，不过还是蛮帅的。
He represented me to communicate with students online.,代表我在网上跟学生沟通。

"In fact, I think the student who communicated with students in my place actually did a decent job, so I think everyone can make a good president.",实际上在人人上面的沟通，我觉得就是那个学生代表我也很像模像样，所以我觉得校长人人都能当。
"Out of this reason, I officially signed up on Renren.com, and finally managed to apply a public homepage of Renren.",正因为这个原因，我自己正式在人人上面注册，而且最后申请到了人人网的公共主页。
"Over the years I have used this homepage to post a lot of information, listened to the opinions of many students, and utilized this platform to conduct pretty much meaningful communication with teachers and students.",多年来我就用了这个主页发布了很多信息，也听取了很多学生的意见，并利用这个平台和老师学生进行了很多有意义的沟通。
"Last year, the students told me I was outdated, so I registered a VIP account on Sina Weibo.",去年，在我们同学们一片你已经out了的呼声下面，我加V注册了新浪微博。
I want to tell you that I now have more than 1.6 million followers.,成为新浪微博的一员，我想告诉大家现在我网上的好友已经超过160万。
"My account is verified with real name, so you all are welcome to follow me.",实名的，你们可以继续加我。
This is not an advertisement.,这不是广告。
I don't really care about whether or not I have 1.6 million followers.,我倒不在乎这160万。
"I really feel that this platform serves as a good window for me to make friends from all walks of life, and also gives me a great opportunity to hear different voices and also be able to send out my ideas and the voice of our university to the public, including many of our students and alumni.",但是我真正地觉得这个平台给了我一个非常好的机会结交各种类型的朋友，也给了我一个很好的机会能够听到不同的声音，同时也能够把我的想法，我们学校的声音，能够通过这个平台能够传递到我们很多社会公众，包括我们很多的学生和校友。
"From BBS to Renren and Weibo, and to WeChat now,",从BBS到人人网到微博，实际上现在我也上微信了。
"I am advancing with the times and indeed following the preferences of the digital natives, because I want to blend in on their social platforms.",我的与时俱进，实实在在地是在追随数字土著这一族的喜好，因为我希望把我自己融入到他们的社交平台上去。
"As a matter of fact, there was a time when I would sit at the computer every night after eleven or even twelve o'clock, just to read the various kinds of information tweeted by students on Renren and Weibo.",告诉在座的各位朋友，曾经有一段时间每天晚上十一点甚至十二点以后我就是坐在电脑面前，在人人上边，在微博上边。
"From the information, I spotted a lot of problems concerning university management.",看学生反映的各种信息，发现了很多学校管理上面的问题。
The leaders of many departments of China Normal University were harassed by me through phone at night.,我们华师大的很多部门的领导都在晚上给我骚扰过。
"When I saw a problem, I would make a phone call to tell them what this was about, and the next day they would be very busy dealing with the problem.",看到问题一个电话打过去，什么什么事情你知道吧，怎么回事情，完了第二天就够他们忙一天。
Such a direct response to university management is needed and welcomed by students.,但是学生喜欢，学校的管理是需要这样的一种直接的反应。
I think such means of communication is completely necessary either for the university management and development or for strengthened cohesion between the faculty and students.,我想这是无论对学校的管理对学校的发展还是增强我们学校师生之间的凝聚力，这样的一种沟通是完全必要的。
"Recently, there have been wide coverage in the media about the installation of air conditioners in student dormitories.",最近，大家也看到媒体上面报道了很多关于学生呼吁学生的宿舍公寓要装空调的这样的报道。
"In fact, two years ago, East China Normal University also faced such situation.",实际上两年前，华东师范大学也面临过这样的情况。
"Our new campus has air conditioners installed in all student dormitories at the early stage of the construction, which I believe is the first university to do so in Shanghai.",我们的新校区在建设初期所有的学生宿舍都安装了空调，我想这在上海可能是第一个高校。
"Our old campus, unfortunately, has no air conditioning due to power supply and funding problems.",但是我们的老校区由于供电能力的问题和经费的问题一直没有装空调。
"More than two years ago, our students expressed their voices to install air conditioners as students in some other colleges and universities do today.",两年多前，学生就像今天的有些高校的学生一样也发出了这样的呼唤声。
What should we do?,怎么办？
How should school leaders face such a request from students?,学校的领导怎么去面对学生的这样的一个诉求？
The first thing we thought is to explain to the students why the campus has not installed air conditioner.,我们想到第一件事情，要告诉同学们，学校现在为什么没有安装空调。
"In addition to money issue, power supply and mechanism also were obstacles.",钱是一个问题，供电能力是一个问题，还有一个机制也是个问题。
"But if we didn't tell the students the truth, maybe we would hear a different voice on the Internet.",但是如果我们不把这些想法告诉同学们听的话，也许我们网上是另一片声音。
So we chose to be honest with students and we also welcomed them to offer their suggestions to solve the problems.,但是一旦讲了以后，我们也征求同学们的意见，请你们谈谈有什么办法来解决这个问题？
"A lot of suggestions came in, which were very inspiring.",啊大家提了好多好多建议，很启发我们的思维。
"During such a kind of interactive communication process, we gradually formed our own ideas and plans.",所以就在这样的一个互动沟通过程当中，我们慢慢的形成了自己的想法和方案。
"On one hand, we tried to raise money to have the power transformation and supply capacity improved.",我们学校想办法筹钱，提高了我们的变电的能力、供电的能力。
We arranged wiring in all dormitories in the campus.,在校内的所有宿舍布了线。
"On the other, we adopted a new mechanism for students to lease air-conditioners to solve the problem of fund shortage.",同时我们采取了一种新的机制让学生租赁空调的办法，来解决资金不足的问题。
"Most of the students agreed with this approach, because the most important thing for them was to have air-conditioning as soon as possible.",而大部分的学生都很认同这样一个做法，因为对他们来讲，最重要的就是要实现最快地实现空调屋。
We made it and we made it two years ago.,我们做成了，两年以前我们已经解决了这个问题。
"I feel such an interactive platform, such a communication mechanism do help the university and have indeed solved many difficulties and conflicts.",我感到这样的一个互动的平台，这样的一种沟通的机制，确确实实帮助学校解决了很多困难，解决了很多矛盾。
"Once on the BBS’ President Online, one student expressed her criticism of the arrangement of an event organized by the university in a very intense language.",曾经在BBS校长在线上，有一位学生用非常激烈的语言对学校组织的某一项活动的安排发表了自己的批评意见。

What was very interesting was that she apologized to me immediately as we met.,很有意思的是她一见面马上就跟我检讨。
"She said that the reason why she was so outspoken was that she felt she could be unrestrained on the Internet, and asked me not to take it personally.",她说之所以口无遮拦，是因为在网上可以随性，请校长不要在意。
"In fact, there are several similar experiences in my life.",其实这样的经历，我有过很多次。
"As the student mentioned, surfing the Internet is to enjoy an equal feeling.",正向这位同学所说的，上网就是享受一种平等的感觉。
Everyone is the same.,大家都是一样的。
"We must maintain a good attitude with tolerance, and gather positive energy with positive, equal and sincere communication.",一定要以宽容保持一种良好的心态，以积极的、平等的、真诚的沟通来集聚正能量。
"Since there is no context in communication online, the ambiguity of discourse is easy to cause ridiculous misunderstandings, and we should learn to use such words as “ho-ho"" and ""ha-ha"" to create a relaxed atmosphere.",网络没有语境，话语的歧义很容易引起可笑的误会，我们要学会用“呵呵”“哈哈”营造宽松的语言氛围。
"If you browse my Weibo, there will always be “ho-ho"" and ""ha-ha” in the beginning of almost every post.",所以你们看我的微博，前面总会有“呵呵”“哈哈”有点磁头怪脑。
"Maybe this kind of expression is somewhat naughty, but everyone seems to like it.",但是大家很友好。
"In the Internet, we can't see the expression of the authors.",网络见不到言者的表情。
"For this reason, we’d better learn to use cute emojis like smile, laugh, and applaud, to show your sense of humor, express your friendly attitude, and let your friends have a good mood.",要学会多用可爱的表情，微笑、大笑、鼓掌，显示你的幽默感，表达你的友好态度，让朋友们也有个好心情。
This is what I have learned through surfing the Internet over the years.,这是我多年来上网的心得。
"Finally, I’d like remind all of you don’t be addicted to the Internet, and this is possible if you spend too much time on Weibo.",最后提醒诸位，小心上瘾，经常上微博有这个可能。
Thank you all!,谢谢大家！
Hello everyone!,大家好！
I'm Yu Xiuhua.,我是余秀华。
"Today my speech is entitled ""Poetry Is Not Something Beyond"".",今天讲的这个题目就是“诗歌没有远方”。
Wang Guozhen once said something about how besides our daily life we also have poetry and something beyond to pursue.,汪国真曾经有一句话，大概意思是说，我们除了世俗的生活还有诗歌和远方。
"These words tricked, and are still tricking, many people.",这句话曾经蛊惑了许多人，当然现在还在继续蛊惑着。
"Luckily for me, I'm not his fan, and so I've never been tricked.",我不喜欢汪国真，所以他不怕蛊惑到我。
"Indeed, there is something beyond.",远方，的确有。
But that doesn't mean it is always good.,但是未必就有好东西。
"We might reach the far-away fairyland, only to find that, instead of blooming flowers, piles of waste are greeting us.",远方也有可能到达，但是等着我们的不一定就是鲜花，更大的可能是一堆垃圾。
I have seen Wang Guozhen once on TV.,我在电视上见过汪国真一次。
It was amazing to hear an old man at his age still using such rhetorical language to talk about the world beyond.,他一把年纪了，还能够大言不惭地说着远方，也的确让人很佩服。
"But sure, Wang Guozhen was a very good poet.",当然，汪国真作为一个牛了这么多年的诗人。
"When he drew parallels between poetry and the world beyond, it was difficult to refute him, for a man can be penniless, but the world beyond is always there accompanying him.",是因为他把远方和诗歌放在一起说，而且还让人没有办法去反驳。因为一个人可以一无所有，但远方永远在。
So is poetry.,诗歌也永远在。
"So that's Wang Guozhen.With this simple dictum, he had his identity as a poet soundly secured.",所以汪国真就靠着这一句话。潇潇洒洒地混诗坛。
"My dear brother Feng Tang once said, ""I guess no one would deny I am a poet after I wrote sentences like 'Spring brightens the world, but pales before you'"".",自从我亲爱的冯唐哥哥说的一句话，他自己说的，他说，我就凭借一句“春风十里不如你”，就没有人敢说他不是一个诗人。
"Speaking of which, anyway, I sincerely wish that I was not remembered for that poem entitled ""I Crossed Half of China to Sleep with You"".",但是，我不希望，也真的不愿意，大家是凭借“穿越大半个中国去睡你”而记住我的。
"Though it might be everyone's wish to do that, to cross half of China to sleep with somebody.",尽管所有的人都是这样在想，尽管所有的人都希望，穿过大半个中国去睡谁。
Poetry actually doesn't have much to do with the world beyond.,其实诗歌和远方没有很大的关系。
"There is something beyond in poetry, but poetry is not located in the world beyond.",诗歌里有远方，但是诗歌不在远方。
"It is, and must be, linked with our actual life.",诗歌是和我们现实的生活联系在一起，而且必然会联系在一起的。
People who write poems understand that.,那些写诗歌写多的人，会明白这里的道理。
"I always tell others that, if someone can't remain true to himself, lets himself down and is as negligible as a grain of dust, then what's the point of his affectation?",我经常说的一句话就是，人如果活得不够真实，对不起自己，茫茫人海，小如尘埃，我们装逼给给谁看？
"And the joy brought by affectation, just like the most beautiful scenery, will wear off in our mind.",更说就算装的再好也不过如此，再美的风景也有厌倦的时候。
"But poetry should not be an affectation. It links us with our life, and is part of life itself.",而诗歌使我和我们的生活联系在一起，是生活的一部分。
We can't imagine a farmer to write about the bustling city life.,一个农民不大可能去写灯红酒绿。
Nor is it possible for an office worker to describe how the barnyard grass looks.,一个白领也不可能写出稗子的模样。
"However, we can't, and shouldn't, refuse imagination.",但是，我们无法拒绝，也不也不应该拒绝的是“想象”。
Without imagination mankind would never have been able to land on the moon.,没有想象，人就不可能登上月球。
"And there is the moon, and the entire universe in poetry.",诗歌里不仅有月球，还有整个宇宙。
"In one's imagination there is not only something beyond, but also something even beyond that.",我我想象，想象里不仅有远方，还有远方的远方。
Poetry is like a path leading into an endless world beyond.,诗歌就是伸进远方的远方的一条途径。
And here its role unfolds.,这里，诗歌的功效就显示出来了。
Poetry means using words to make imagination concrete.,诗歌是把不同的想象具具体化，白纸黑字摆在你面前。
It seems as if a door has been opened for us to discover the secrets of the universe.,它仿佛打开了一条途径，让你看到了宇宙的秘密。
So poetry cannot just be written.,所以诗歌经不起草率的书写。
Any cursory attempt would be ridiculed by poetry itself.,这样会被诗歌本身所嘲笑。
"A poet must be scrupulous, and also think.",它要求你用心，还要求你是一个有思想的人。
Devotion and thoughts are both necessary.,二者缺一不可。
Those who equate any combination of lines with a poem must be as naive as those who think they are winning the Mahjong game whenever they draw 13 tiles.,那些认为分行的文字就是诗歌的人，他们大约以为起了十三个麻将子就能够胡牌。
"I always think that a poet should, more than anyone else, be a philosopher.",我我说过，诗人更应该是哲人，
His philosophy does not have much to do with what we learn from the philosophy textbook.,当然这里的哲学和书本上的哲学理论没有什么关系。
"It is always the thoughts in a poem, rather than a refreshing sentence, that will influence us.",这里的哲学真正能够感染我们、影响我们的不是一句清新的句子，而是这些思想。
Those philosophical thoughts are only effective when they are combined with our life and feelings and strike a chord.,这些哲学理论能够和我们现实的生生活，和我们的感受结合起来联系在一起并产生效应的，这才是有效果的。
"So if one wants to write good poems, he must keep learning and thinking.",所以一个人想要写好诗歌，就应该不停地学习，不停地思考。
That's the most basic work for a poet.,这是一个诗人最基本的功课。
"Those who think being a poet is easy are either too silly, or just speculative.",那些认为诗人好当的人，要不就是二百五，要不就是是为了投机取巧。
In real life there is no room for speculation.,但是诗歌里但是生活里没有投机取巧，
Nor should there be speculation in poetry.,诗歌里更不应该有。
We write poems because we love them.,我们是因为喜欢诗歌才来写诗歌。
Nothing will daunt me so much as the thought that I am letting myself down.,我不怕别的，我就怕对不起自己的这份喜欢。
"As for me, I am known to you by several labels, such as cerebral palsy poet, or countrywoman poet.",我是带着一个个标签出现在你们面前的，什么脑瘫诗人、什么农妇诗人。
"And rest assured, I hate those who call me countrywoman.",说我是农妇的都不是好人。
Or grass-roots poet.,还有什么草根诗人。
"I never respond to or refute those labels, for I am a kind person.",面对这些我从来不出来说什么、反驳什么，因为我很善良。
I can understand that they are actually necessary for publicity.,也因为我理解这是传播的一种形式和需要，
"It's like, for example, the title of some WeChat article which might read ""Look! This woman is naked!"", but when you click on the link and open the article, you see some puppies instead.",就像现在许多微信标题上写着，看呐，这个女人一丝不挂，等你打开来就几条小狗。
But here I must emphasize that poetry has no labels.,但是我必须强调的是，诗歌没有标签。
It should not in any way be labeled.,也不应该存在标签。
"Any label attached to poetry is misleading, is disturbing and misunderstanding it, and is merely a short-sighted self-approbation.",任何标签都不对，任何标签都是对诗歌的干预和误读，都是一种自以为是的狭隘。
Nowadays two labels for poetry are quite popular: the academic poetry and the grass-roots poetry.,现在比较广泛的标签分为学院派和草根派。
"Well, the academic poets might have received better, more systematic education.",好吧，你是学院派，你有文化，你有系统的教育，
They might even be educating people with their systematic knowledge.,又在系统地教育着别人。
Their knowledge has led them to a higher rung on the ladder.,你的知识提高了你的社会地位。
But what does that have to do with poetry?,但是，这与诗歌有什么关系呢？
"If more knowledge and better education are equal to good poetry, then the Nobel Prize award ceremonies might have been crammed with Chinese winners.",如果说一个人的文凭高、知识多，就能够把诗歌写好，那我们中国不知道要拿回多少个诺贝尔奖。
"No, actually I am not right about that, for Chinese people are so proud.",但是我们中国人是有骨气的。
We don't think too much of the Nobel Prize.,这这个诺贝尔奖也不大看中。
The grass-roots poets are those who live among the underclass.,所谓草根派，就指生活在底层的诗人。
It means that they have lower social status and living standards.,这里指的是他们的社会地位和生活状态。
But I never feel it's a bad thing at all to live among the grass-roots.,但是我从来不觉得草根人生有什么不好。
Nor is our life or soul inferior to that of anyone else.,我不觉得我们的生活、我们的灵魂就低人一等。
"I believe all the people are equal in being proud, so long as we understand and love our life.",我相信上天会给所有人平等的尊严，只要你足够地理解生活并且热爱生活。
"But of course it's not easy to understand and love life, like I mentioned earlier, you just don't win the Mahjong game because you have drawn13 tiles.",当然，这个理解和热爱也不是那么容易的，它同样不是起了十三个麻将就能胡牌的简单。
"All those divisions and labels, under close scrutiny, are actually not so important.",其实，那些区分和标签，仔细一想，也没有什么关系。
They are merely a pastime in some people' boring life.,它就是那些无聊的人找个事情来打发自己的业余时间。
Or else how should they spend the rest of their life?,嗯，不然他们怎么来度过自己的余生？
But poetry itself never changes just because it is labeled differently.,但是诗歌就是诗歌的本身，它不会被谁贴上标签就变得不一样。
"What people think or encounter is different, then what they feel will also be different.",诗人的心或环境不一样，看到的事物不一样，他的感受就会不一样。
Hence their poems are also different.,写出来的诗歌和文字当然不一样！
"So we have to allow for the existence of some divisions and labels, so long as they exist on a small scale.",嗯，所以，我，那些我们允许小范围的标签和区分存在。
"But if anyone goes too far in that way, I should say he is hopelessly ignorant.",但是如果说，谁老是拿这个事来说事，就是很无知很无知的。
There is another thing I want to talk about here.,我这里好像讲错了一点。
"The other day, someone left a message on my blog, which I translated as: Yu Xiuhua, you can stop writing poems right now!","前几天有人在我的博客里留言,他的意思是说：余秀华，你现在可以停笔不写了！"
I wonder what he meant.,我不知道他是什么意思。
Was he telling me that my poems were getting worse and worse for his taste?,是觉得我的诗歌写得不如以前，他看不下去了？
Or that I should resign and not cling to the so-called fame I've earned?,还是说我现在获得了一点虚名就应该急流勇退？
"I could agree with neither though, especially the second.",我觉得这两种说法都不对，尤其是第二种。
No one is writing poems to gain fame and fortune.,我们没有谁是为了名利在写诗歌。
"I don't know other people, but I'm sure I am not that kind of person.",别人我不知道，反正我不是。
"When one starts writing a poem, the moment he takes up a pen, he has already dispelled utilitarian thoughts from his mind.",当一个人拿起笔来写诗歌的时候，他已经从内心里排除了名利。
That is a poet's natural consciousness.,这是一种先天性的自觉自觉。
"Material things may change the external environment, but they rarely have a chance to alter the world in our mind.",物质可以改变我们的生活环境，但是很难改变我们的内心环境。
"Just think, if one's inner mind is so susceptible to external forces, then how can he persist in his dreams, especially the unprofitable dreams about poetry?",是说，一个人的内心环境如果那么容易就改变，那么他还能坚持他的梦想吗？特别是毫无无利可图的诗歌梦想。
"Poetry for me is a spiritual journey, which soothes my heart and brings me peace of mind.",我觉得诗歌是一种修行，它能给我们的心灵带来安慰和平静。
"When a poet is writing, he is actually refreshing and repairing himself.",一个人写诗歌的过程，就是不断提醒自己和修复自己的过程。
"When one is attached to something and grows along with it, he might also, in the process, receive affection in return from that thing.",当一个人对一样事物有充分的喜欢，万物像万物一样生长，那么他有可能在这个过程中，得到万物同样的回应。
That will be enough.,这就是足够了。
And that's all I feel about being a poet.,这就是写诗人的境界。
And all I want to say today.,好，我讲完了。
Thank you!,谢谢！
Thank you.,谢谢大家。
I almost got hypnotized.,刚才我差点被催眠。
"Ho-ho, I must thank Ikkyu-san.",呵呵，感谢一休哥哦。
"In the United States, Indians wear Indian clothes, Middle Eastern people wear Middle Eastern clothes, and we Chinese also wear Chinese clothes.",在美国呢，印度人穿印度人的衣服，中东人穿中东人的衣服，那我们中国人呢，也穿中国人的衣服。
I have worn this suit for decades.,我穿这套衣服穿了几十年了。
"A few years ago, because of the publication of novels, including those I just presented to you, I had to come back to China to do some promotion activities.",在几年前，因为小说的出版，刚才大家看到啊，介绍过一些小说，那么我要回来国内呢是做一些推广活动。
I was very glad that I had returned to Beijing.,很高兴我又回到了北京。
"When I was in New York, I took the subway a lot, which I’m used to till today.",因为我在纽约呢，是习惯坐地铁的，我到今天我都习惯坐地铁。
"And in Beijing, the most convenient form of transport must be the subway.",在北京最方便就这个了。
"At that time, I just came back from abroad. On the subway, a woman suddenly patted me on the shoulder and said, “Hey, I know you.”",那么我到地铁的时候呢有个大姐，那几年前我刚刚回来了，她就突然间拍我的肩膀，诶，我认识你。
I was very happy to be identified.,我一听可高兴了。
"“Oh, you know me. That's great. Do you know who I am?”",哦，你都认识我，那太棒了，你知道我是谁吗？
"“I know that you are from Deyun Club, and you perform cross talk,” said she.",她说我知道，你是说相声的，德云社。
"Thank you very much, Mr. Guo Degang.",真是感谢郭德纲先生。
"Actually, I'm just a writer.",其实我只是写书的。
Today I’d like to talk about the book - Shaking Dragon Classic.,那今天呢我们是来介绍一下《撼龙经》这本书。
"By the way, the story I just told you was what truly happened to me.",那刚才说了这个故事啊，是很真实的哦，是我亲身经历的事情。
"If you pick up the book, you will find that this book has encountered the same problem as I had on the subway.",但是当我们拿着这本书的时候，我们就发现，这本书跟我一样，遇到了同样的问题。
Both of us have labels.,就是它被披上了一件外衣。
"I have been known for being a crosstalk comedian of Deyun Club, while the book for canvassing feng shui.",我被披上了一件德云社的外衣，它呢，被披上了一个风水的外衣。
Feng shui might be a sensitive topic to many of you.,这个课题也许让很多朋友都觉得很敏感。
This book was written a thousand years ago in the Tang Dynasty.,这本书呢，它在一千年前出现，唐朝出现。
"At that time, there were only a few feng shui books in China, maybe only two or three famous ones.",在那个时候，中国还没有几本风水书，最出名的也就那两三本。
"Moreover, the feng shui books then were very mysterious and laconic.",而且呢，那时候的风水书凤毛麟角，片言只语，神神秘秘。
But things began to change because of the Shaking Dragon Classic.,但是从这本开始《撼龙经》。
"From this book, people can learn feng shui in a systematic, methodical, and simple manner.",从它开始，进入了进入了一个有系统、有方法、可以学习的，可以很简单的学习的时代。
"Since then, this book has become the bedrock of modern feng shui theory.",从此之后，这本书便成了近代风水学的开山鼻祖。
"After the Song Dynasty, because of the prosperity of Neo-Confucianism, many metaphysical contents, such as yin and yang, the Wu Xing, also known as the Five Elements, and the Eight Diagrams, were combined with geography.",那么在宋朝之后，因为理学的昌盛，很多玄学的内容，比如说阴阳、五行、八卦跟地理学结合起来了。
"Gradually, feng shui study switched from macroscopic perspectives to microscopic ones, and finally we have managed to scale down the bigger things.",于是慢慢地从宏观到了微观，最后我们把一些很大很大的内容最后缩到很小。
"Today, when we talk about feng shui, you will immediately think of opening the door and arranging the refrigerator.",今天我们一说起看风水，你就会想到，哦，开门，摆电冰箱。
"But the odd thing is that there was no refrigerator in ancient times, considering feng shui is a kind of ancient culture.",在古代没有电冰箱，不过也也当是古代的文化啊，好奇怪。
"Well, in fact, we have seen the back side, i.e. the dark side of the Shaking Dragon Classic, while what is the bright side of the book?",那么其实呢，这一点我们是看到了《撼龙经》的背面，恰恰好，这是《撼龙经》的阴暗的一面，而真正《撼龙经》光明的一面是什么呢？
"This book, in addition to being the bedrock of feng shui theory, also contains the relic of Chinese geography over more than two thousand years.",这本书，它除了是风水学的开山鼻祖，它还是我们中国两千多年地理学的遗迹，就在这里。
"When I was studying geography in the United States, I found that it has much in common with the content of the Shaking Dragon Classic.",在我在美国学习地理学的时候，我就发现，它跟我们《撼龙经》的内容有很多相通的地方。
"As a matter of fact, Shaking Dragon Classic writes a lot about China's geography, in a very detailed way.",原来《撼龙经》这本书呢，用了很大的篇幅去介绍中国的地理，而且介绍的非常丰富详实。
"More importantly, what this book writes about is consistent with modern geography.",更重要的是，这本书做了一点，跟现代地理学完全吻合的作用。
You may not be familiar with modern geography.,现代地理学可能大家会理解不了啊。
What is geography?,什么叫地理学？
"You may feel that geography means turning up the soil, or digging holes to find mines.",大家可能会觉得去翻翻地啊，挖个洞找找矿。
"That is geology, not geography.",那叫地质学，那不叫地理学。
Geography is a discipline that studies the relationship between man and land.,地理学是研究人地关系的。
"The man-land relationship means that you go to survey a place, and then you can know what will happen there.",人地关系的意思就是，你去勘察这块地方，然后，你可以知道这里会发生什么事情。
"Although it does not necessarily lead to a definite result, it can give us a good reference for the future, or help you choose a good place at least.",虽然，它不一定是一个确定性的结果，但是，它可以给我们面对未来做很好的参考，最简单，它起码可以帮你选一个好地方。
"In this sense, this book represents a division line of Chinese geography in the Tang Dynasty.",所以这本书，它代表着唐朝对中国地理学的一条分野线。
"The upper section of the line is about geography, while the lower section involves feng shui.",这条线，上面是地理学，下面是风水学。
And the line embodies the essence of both geography and feng shui.,但是全部都浓缩在这里。
All these theories are a bit metaphysical.,这些理论都有点虚。
Let's take a look.,我们来看一下。
This book is divided into three parts.,这本书呢它讲了三个部分。
The first part describes the big picture of China.,第一部分，它讲的是中国的大形势。
"It introduces China from north to south, from Kunlun Mountain, to Northeast China, and to South Korea, which was mentioned as Samhan, an ancient name for southern Korean peninsula, on the book.",从昆仑山，从上面一直往下讲，最后讲到了东北地区，讲到了韩国，在这本书上称为三韩啊，三韩是对韩国地区的一个古称。
"Well, I believe people who have studied geography will be very clear about the first part.",那么这一部分呢，我们现在学过地理学的朋友都会很清晰。
The exciting parts are the second and third parts.,那真正精彩的是，第二和第三部分。
"The second part talks about a series of ideas, including the concept of harmony between man and nature.",第二部分呢，它是讲到了一系列的理念，天人合一的理念。
"These ideas symbolize genuine forethought to geography, which were more profound and direct than those in Western geography.",通过这些理念，我们真正感受到比西方地理学还要深入的，还要直接。
"They incorporate all aspects of geography, macroscopical and microscopic, even human beings.",甚至是从大到小，小到每一个人的，这样的一种地理关怀。
"You may have heard that mountain is related to prosperity, while water to wealth.",这句话大家很熟悉啊，山管人丁水管财。
Anyone who engages in feng shui business would tell you such a saying.,任何一个搞风水的人，他都会搞告诉你，山管人丁水管财。
Why is that？,为什么？
"He/she would say if you want to make a fortune, there must be good water in front of your house, and if you wish to have a large family and good health, there must be auspiciously-shaped mountains.",他说你想发财，前面就要有好水，你想家里人丁兴旺身体健康，你就要有好的山形。
"Or in modern feng shui theory, there must be auspiciously-shaped buildings, which is related to family member and safety.",或者说在现代的风水学说，认为需要有很好的楼宇的形状，建筑物的形状，这跟人丁有关，跟安全有关。
Is this superstition?,这是迷信吗？
I believe so.,我认为是迷信。
But the same saying in the Shaking Dragon Classichas nothing to do with superstition.,但是在《撼龙经》出现这句话的时候，它跟迷信没有关系。
"As we look back into the ancient times, China has had the concept of geography way before the Tang Dynasty, hence the “astronomy and geography” nowadays.",我们回头去看在古代，原来在唐朝之前，中国有地理学的概念，所以我们说“天文地理”。
"Geography is not a term from abroad, instead, it is a Chinese term.",地理学不是一个西洋名词，这是一个中国名词。
Geography studies how to choose a place to establish the capital or a city.,地理学，研究的是怎么样选择地方成为首都，成为城市。
"There is another theory, focusing on the study of favorable geological positions, which is derived from geography and studies how to build villages and towns.",还有另一种，从地理学发源出来的，叫地利学，是研究怎么样建立一个村镇的。
"By integrating all these elements, the author of the book summarized them into one saying, that is,  mountain is related to prosperity, while water wealth.",那么在这些东西综合之后，这本书的作者，把它综合成几句话，叫山管人丁水管财。
"However, the mountain refers to favorable geographic environment.",原来，这个山字，它讲的是良好的地理环境。
The fertility of land and mountain determines whether we can grow crops and whether people can survive here.,地和山好不好决定了我们能不能种植，人类能不能在这里生存。
"Please note that, it is vital to human survival, so the author says mountain is related to prosperity.",记住，是人类生存啊，所以山管人丁。
"As for the second part of the saying, that is, water is related to wealth, that’s because the economic exchanges in ancient times are quite different from today.",水管财呢，我们可以看看古代，在古代的经济交流跟现在是不一样的。
"There are a lot of logistics methods at present, while in ancient times, the best logistics means was waterway transportation.",现在我们有很多物流方式，在古代最好的就是水路。
"As the cheapest and the fastest transportation, waterway not only brought about commerce and trades, logistics and business opportunities, etc., but also prospered the land.",水路是最便宜最快的，而且水路呢它除了带来商贸、物流、商业机会等等等等，它还会滋润这块大地。
"Therefore, the ancient people attached great importance to the coexistence of mountains and rivers.",所以古代人很重视山水并存。
Only there are mountains and rivers at the same time can a place be called an auspicious one.,山管人丁水管财，有这一件有那一件，才称之为好。
I was surprised when I read this book.,当时我在看这本书的时候很惊讶。
The author described the geographical environment of China and even the world by category.,这个作者啊他还做了另一件事情，他把整个中国的，甚至说，我现在走遍世界啊，他把全世界的地理环境，都能够分类描述一遍。
"When I was a child, I admired the author Yang Yunsong very much, who was addressed respectfully as Yang Gong in the community of geography.",小时候我很崇拜他，杨筠松，在地理学界呢尊称为杨公。
"When I grew up, I gradually figured out, this book, in fact, was not written by him alone, because its origin is very legendary.",长大了我明白了，其实这不是他一个人写出来的，因为这本书的来历非常传奇。
"Yang Yunsong served as Guanglu Daifu, in the end of the Tang Dynasty, a time of chaos.",他是在唐朝末年，天下大乱的时候，这个杨筠松，杨公，他是当时朝廷里面的光禄大夫。
He was responsible for geomantic geography.,是一个做风水地理的官员。
"During the chaos, he fled from the imperial palace in Chang’an together with a lot of rare books, all the way southward to Jiangxi, and to Guangdong in the end.",那么当时呢，他在逃跑的时候，带了很多禁宫里面的秘籍，背起就跑，一直从北往南，从长安一直跑到了江西，最后还跑到了广东。
"On his journey, he took some apprentices and sorted out the books he brought along with him and complied into such a short book.",在这一路上呢，他一边收徒弟，一边整理经文，最后变成了这么一本薄薄的书。
The books he brought along with him were exactly the ancient geographical literatures that are increasingly hard to find now in China.,那么他带出来的资料里面，正好是现在我们中国越来越找不到，越来越稀缺的古代的地理资料。
"As a matter of fact, from the books of the ancient philosophers including the Commentary on the Water Classic and the Classic of Mountains and Seas, we can discover that our ancestors, including Zhuang Zi and Guan Zi, are very familiar with geological environment.",所以其实我们在庄子，在古代的管子，在那些诸子百家书里面，我们会看到我们的前人啊，包括像《水注经》，像《山海经》，他们对地理环境是非常熟悉的。
Finally the Shaking Dragon Classic summarized the essence of the previous books into systematic categories.,最后总结成这里，有了一个有系统的分类。
"Before the book, there were never systematic categories, but only accumulation, one book by another.",但在此之前，从来没有分类，只有堆积，一个一个地全部排出来，但是没有系统。
Why Yang Gong would think of doing such a thing?,那么杨公他为什么会去做这么一件事情呢？
"That’s because as a government official, he was determined to serve the people.",因为杨公啊，他从一个朝廷的官员，一直往下走，走向民间。
He hoped this technique of feng shui could be put into use by the common folks.,他很希望这种技术让老百姓去用，老百姓怎么用啊。
"I have learned geography for several years, and till now, I have to continue to research and verify things all around the world.",我学地理学我都学几年，到现在，还是在不停地研究印证，再研究再印证，而全世界的跑。
"By no means could Yong Gong visit so many places by himself, so he could only resort to ancient literatures.",杨公一个人是跑不了那么多地方的，他只能组织很古老的资料。
He sorted out the content for the common folks to use.,整理整理再整理，然后呢，让老百姓去用。
"Yang Gong put forward a very special concept, which later became the basis of feng shui theory.",杨公提出了一个很特殊的概念，这也造成了后来的风水学有了一个依据，但是他提出的概念也有原因。
What Yang Gong proposed at the time was to match the seven stars in the Big Dipper to all the terrains on the ground.,杨公当时提出的是，把天上的七星，北斗七星，对应了地上的全部地形。
"The Big Dipper includes Greedy Wolf, Huge Door and Military Arts, as you can see today,",那么在北斗七星里面呢，呃包括了大家现在看到的贪狼、巨门和武曲，这都是其中三个。
"Out of the severn stars, three are auspicious stars.",因为在七星里面呢，有三种是吉星。
Why did he propose such a concept?,他为什么要这样提炼呢？
Because studying geography is a very complicated task.,因为研究地理是一件很复杂的事情。
"Yesterday, when I was working on a TV show with a meteorologist, he told me that if he studied geography now, he would use a lot of instruments to analyze a place first before he could decide whether the place is livable.",昨天我跟一个气象专家在做一个电视节目的时候，他告诉我说，现在研究地理的话，他会先去找很多仪器过来先把这里分析一遍，然后决定能不能住。
Yet I had a different view on that.,当时我有另一个意见。
I said that I would look at the geographic pattern of the place first.,我说我会先看看地地理的形态。
I would only conduct an analysis if the geographic pattern meets the requirements.,起码行态满足我们的要求，我们再去分析这些东西。
I think my way will be faster than his.,我觉得我会比他更快。
Why is that?,为什么呢？
My approach is similar with the idea in the Shaking Dragon Classic.,跟《撼龙经》的想法是一样的。
"The Shaking Dragon Classic mentioned a concept called peak, also known as star peak, which matches the Big Dipper in the sky.",在《撼龙经》里面提出了一个概念，叫做峰，也称为星峰，因为它对应天上的北斗七星。
All these star peaks are iconic.,那么这些星峰呢，它是标志性的。
"For instance, through high mountains and lofty hills, you will find the Greedy Wolf star.",比如在一片崇山峻岭里面，你会看到有一个贪狼星。
Sorry.,sorry。
Let’s take a look at the Greedy Wolf star.,那么贪狼星呢它有个特点。
"Both sides of the star are straight, with a point in the middle, which just echoes the shape of the Tan Lang Mountain.",它就是左右两边是平直的，然后呢，它有尖尖，这是汤狼贪狼山的一个特点啊。
"According to the book, the appearance of the Greedy Wolf star means the area centered on the star is livable, and people who live here are especially good at studying and easy to gain political and cultural edges.",那么这种星，它只要出现，在《撼龙经》里面呢认为，它会代板代表这个地区，以这个星为核心的这个地区，都可以住人，而且这里的人还特别善于读书，特别容易得到政治上面、文化上面的优势。
"We can see the rudiment of geography here, but we can also find the cultural dislocation when spreading a very profound culture to a common person.",那么这一种，我们可以看到地理学的雏形，但是也可以看到，在把一个很深奥的文化传播到很简单的人身上的时候的那种断层。
"The cause and effect are separated, due to deep reasons.",从因到果，中间是割裂的，但是其中呢，有很深奥的原因在里面。
Please pay attention.,我们注意一下哦。
"Here, the Greedy Wolf star is sharp, while the Ju Men star is flat, meaning it should map flat-topped mountains.",这里呢贪狼星，是尖的，然后巨门星呢是平的，平顶山。
"When I talked to our organizers a few days ago, they didn't believe there is a flat-topped mountain.",我前两天，跟我们的主办方去谈的时候，他们都不相信，山有平的吗。
The truth is there are flat mountains.,山真是有平的。
"You see, in the second picture, there is a flat-topped mountain.",你看，第二个图就是一个平顶山。
"In fact, the number of such mountains are quiet a few, whose shape is very favorable.",而且还不少，平顶山是非常好的啊。
"There is also a round-topped mountain, like a small steamed bun, the one at the bottom, and the bottom star is called Wu Qu star.",还有一个呢是圆头的山，小馒头，就最下面的那个，最下面那个称为武曲星。
"You see, this type of mountain is particularly delicate, and more importantly, especially neat.",那么这种类型的山啊，大家会看到是特别秀气，特别整齐，还有一个呢很重要的就是，特别工整。
"This kind of neatness represents the fact that in the crustal movement, they have not been greatly affected, and they have been stable for hundreds of millions of years or even billions of years at least.",这种工整，代表着在地壳运动里面，它们没有受到很大的冲击，至少它们已经经过了几亿年甚至是几十亿年的稳定。
"When I was in Taiwan, I happened to work with a geologist.",我到台湾的时候，我正好跟一个地质学家一起去办一些事情。
"During that time, someone asked me if this piece of land was stable.",当时，有人问我，说这块地稳不稳定。
I said that the land had enjoyed hundreds of millions of years of history.,我说，这里已经有几亿年的意识历史了。
"The geologist pointed out, the land was, in fact, younger than I said, and Taiwan had only a history of 100 million years.",地质学家说，其实这里更年轻，台湾其实只有一亿年的历史。
"As you can imagine, how long it takes for such a big island to stabilize.",你可想而知，这么大的一个岛，要稳定下来，它需要的时间是多么的漫长。
Then you can see what we humans were 100 million years ago.,那么也可以看到，我们人类，在一亿年前是什么。
"At that time, there was no human beings but only dinosaurs.",哪有人，在那时候全是恐龙。
The beautiful scenery we see today evolved from the age of dinosaurs.,我们看到这么漂亮的风景是从恐龙时代来的。
How touching it is!,够感动了吧！
"Ok, this represents crustal stability and the soft shape refers to the thickness of the stratum and soil layer.",好了，那么这代表着一种地壳的稳稳定，同时呢，这种柔和的外形，它也代表着地层，土层的厚度。
Let’s get back to the steamed bun-shaped mountain.,你想那个馒头山。
Could it be covered with rocks?,大家看看它可能是石头么？
Of course not. It must be covered with thick soil layer and vegetation.,它一定是有很厚的土层，很好的植被。
"If there are drum-shaped stone blocks, starkly raised up like the tips of knives in the mountains, its soil layer must be thin.",如果我们的山脉我们的地形里面，是有石骨，狰狞地翘起来，像刀尖一样的话，它的土层一定是薄的。
"You may say the view is wonderful, but the place is not necessarily livable.",那么你可以说它风景很好，但是不一定适合人居住。
Please take a look at these mountains here.,大家还看一看哦，这里呢。
"They share a common feature, that is, both sides of them are symmetrical.",这些山，它有一个特点，它就是正，两边是对称的。
"From such symmetry, it’s easy for us to understand about the stars.",这种两边的对称呢，也很容易让我们把握到。
"Just as mentioned in the Shaking Dragon Classic, the stars are the greatest existence in the sky.",在《撼龙经》里面提到的，星是什么，星是天上最伟大的。
"In this sense, like the ancient people, we also worship the sun, moon and stars.",所以我们在崇拜古代的古人崇拜，崇拜日月，崇拜星星。
And the peaks map onto stars.,而峰呢，峰跟星是对应的。
"In terms of geography, peaks are the most important, perfect, iconic element.",峰，是在地理学里面，最重要的最完美的最有标志性的。
They represent a metaphysical approach and symbolization of geography.,这是一种对地理学的形而上学，也是对地理学的符号化。
"However, this kind of symbolization finally evolved into metaphysics in feng shui theory, which can be seen as either an error or another application.",但是这种符号化，最终被风水学演变成一种玄学，这可以说是一个误差，也可以说另是另一种运用。
We don’t need to discuss geomantic culture here.,风水的文化我们不需要在这里探讨。
But we can find out where the wisdom of ancient people comes from.,但是我们可以看到古人的智慧是从哪里开始的。
"Ok, let’s have a brief summary.",好，我们可以很简单地总结一下。
"You see in this short book, Yong Gong has extracted the essence of the rare books he brought out from the imperial palace.",你看这本书哦，杨公帮我们总结了一遍，他把他从大内带出来的禁禁书啊。
All of them were summarized in this thin book.,全部都总结成这么薄这么小的一本书。
"Actually, we can put it in other words to make it more relevant to Chinese geography, to make it simpler, more accessible, more effective and more readily available.",我们其实还可以总结一下，这样才像我们中国的地理学嘛，简单、快捷、有效、马上可以用。
"It can be simplified into three words— softness, regularity and aggregation.",总结成可以三个字，就是柔、正、聚。
"As for softness, it means when we choose a place to live, it should have thick soil layer, abundant vegetation and water.",柔呢，大家要看到想选择一个地方的时候，它是地层丰厚的，绿化充足的，有水。
"In the field of geography, Chinese geography in particular, softness also means zigzags.",那么柔的概念呢，同时在地理学上，特别是中国地理学啊，它还代表着一点，是蜿蜒曲折。
Many people in the community of Chinese feng shui theory would tell you that zigzag is sentimental while straightness is the opposite.,在中国风水学里面很多人都会说，曲则有情直则无情。
"Yes, that's right.",对，没错。
There are quite a few artistic elements in Chinese geography.,中国的地理学是有艺术性在里面的，有相当的艺术成分。
"Such artistic elements are not only an embodiment of data, but also arouse our sentiment.",这种艺术成分，不只是从数据上关怀我们，它还从情感上关怀我们。
"Therefore, softness is very important as it represents sentiment.",所以柔很重要，柔则有情。
"As we just mentioned, regularity means safety.",正是代表着安全，刚才我们提过了。
"The less the ground shakes, the longer it stays stable, the easier the mountain or the land becomes symmetrical and neat.",地面，它的震动越少，至少它安稳的时间越越长，那么这个山体，这片地形，它越容易成为对称平整的状态。
"And such terrain provides us with clear targets, symbols or marks when we analyze its geomancy.",这也给我们选择的时候留下了一个很好的目标、符号、标志。
"Without the need of further analysis, we only have to know that this is an auspicious place.",我们不需要懂太多，我们就知道它是正的，就成了。
The third word is aggregation.,第三点，就是聚。
"The Shaking Dragon Classic mentioned many kinds of great environmental conditions, which can be aggregated together.",在《撼龙经》里面介绍了很多很好的环境，那么这些环境呢，它都可以凝聚在一起。
Take Beijing as an example.,像我们北京。
"Beijing is a typical place with great environment, where there are mountains in the back, rivers in the front and plains in the middle.",北京就是一个典型的，聚好地地方，后面有山，前面有水，中间有平原。
These all are the best environmental conditions described in the Shaking Dragon Classic.,这些都是《撼龙经》里面介绍最好的环境。
"Through this book, I hope you can understand why I’m standing here today.",通过这本书，我希望大家，能够理解我站在这里的意思。
"Here we are at TnDao, and are you all here for Tao?",今天我们站在这里是听道论坛，大家真的是来听道的么？
"But the book indeed talks about Tao, just like the saying in the Tao Te Ching goes, “Man takes his law from the Earth; the Earth takes its law from Heaven; Heaven takes its law from the Tao. The law of the Tao is its being what it is”.",但是这本书真的是在讲道，因为在《道德经》里面说，人法地，地法天，天法道，道法自然。
Nowadays people who learn Tao will skip the whole middle process to directly arrive at man being what it is.,现在大家是怎么学道的，人就自然了，中间全没了。
"On the contrary, our ancestors from Lao Zi to Yang Gong, and all scholars who study geography sincerely want to set the focus of our research first on the earth, which corresponds to ""man takes his law from the Earth.""",但是我们的古人从老子到杨公，到我们每一个研究地理学的学者都希望，我们的研究，从脚下开始，从大地开始，真正做到人法地。
"Even if we don’t have profound needs, I hope we can think one more question.",就算我们没有那么高深的需求，我也希望，我们再思考多一个问题。
"In today's society, we impart wealth to our children.",今天我们都是留财富给孩子的。
What our society impart to our children can be either wealth or culture.,我们今天这个社会留给孩子的，可以是财富，可以是文化。
"The question is, can we impart to them a beautiful, livable earth where they can survive and prosper generation after generation?",我们现在也在留文化，我们能够留一块，非常优美非常适合他们生存，能够一直繁衍下去的大地吗？
I hope you all think hard about this question.,希望大家深深地思考这个问题。
Thank you!,谢谢！
"Today, I’d like to share with you my understanding of the big and the small.",我今天讲的题目是小大之道。
"According to Taoism, “The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao"".",我们都知道，道可道，非常道。
"Today, I’d like to adapt it into “The small that can be seen is not the essential small”.",但我今天要讲小；小可小，非常小。
Let me start with a small kettle.,我要从一个小小的水壶讲起。
"The kettle was designed by Michael Graves, a very well-known American architect.",这个水壶是一个大建筑师设计的，一个美国的格雷夫斯，这个建筑师非常有名。
He also made this kettle a most well-known one.,但是他设计的这个水壶呢也是非常有名，变成是最著名的一个嘻大设计师设计的小水壶。
It was actually designed for the famous Italian brand Alessi in 1985.,那这个水壶有个特点，它是为意大利的非常著名的品牌Alessi设计的，1985年的时候出出台的。
"This kettle features a bird-shaped whistle at the end of the spout, which tweets when the water comes to a boil.",那么这个水壶呢它前面有个嘴，上面有个鸟，等到水一开的时候呢它就会叫。
"Then, you just need to hold its handle to pour the water out.",然后呢你拎起那个把手倒水非常方便。
"As we know, usually you need to tilt the kettle to pour the water out.",我们都有这个经验，我们很多水壶啊你都要用力去扳才倒得出来。
"But with this design, the water will just spill out naturally.",它那个自然而然就出来了。
"Its designer Michael Graves is quite an accomplished architect whose masterpieces include the Portland Building (Oregon), the Humana Building (Louisville), as well as Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Resorts (Florida).",那么这个建筑师呢他其实是大建筑师，他设计过像这个是美国俄勒冈州的波特兰市政厅，还有一个是那个呃路易斯维尔的一个呃休曼纳大厦，还设计过像呃那个迪斯尼的天鹅宾馆，还有那个海豚宾馆。
"Moreover, his works can also be seen in the Chinese cities of Xiamen and Shanghai.",他也曾经在中国设计过，在厦门、在上海都有大作品。
"He pays special attention to designing daily household items such as tea cups, bird’s nests and mail boxes.",但是他就注重这种我们日常生活里面的小小的东西，他设计过茶杯、呃设计过鸟窝、设计过信箱。
He prefers to approach art from small items that are most familiar to him in everyday life.,因为他觉得这个生活是最亲切的，要从小处着手。
It happens that there is another well-known US architect who designed a bus shelter for a French company for mass production.,然后无独有偶，有一个美国的也是大建筑师，他设计了这么一个小小的候车亭，这个候车亭呢是为那个呃法国的一家公司作为批量生产。
"In a non-Cartesian coordinates form, the shelter was supported by foldable steel plates.",它就用折叠钢板把它做起来，它有一种折叠非折叠的这种我们叫它非笛卡尔的这种空间的形式来做这么一个小小的候车亭。
"And it was made in Aachen, a small city in Germany.",这个是候车亭是在德国的一个小小的城市阿亨那么建造起来。
"It may seem nothing extraordinary, but this small shelter has its own merit.",这个有什么特点呢，我们说没什么了不起是吧，但是一个小小的候车亭它有它的学问。
"When we wait for bus, we always prefer to see it coming without being exposed to the rain.",我们等车子总希望看得见来的车子，还有不能够有雨淋到你身上，对吧。
"So, the shelter is supposed to keep out wind and rain, and prevent naughty kids from climbing over it, too.",所以要避开风雨又要看得见，但是呢又不能让那些顽童爬上去，还要考虑这个。
"It stretches like a kingcrab, with an electronic screen in front of it to indicate time and present other information.",它像一个巨蟹一样，前面还有一个电子屏幕，上面有时钟，对吧，告诉你什么时间了，然后可以做各种电子的这个信息。
These details were also designed by the architect.,这也是个大建筑师设计的。
"In this sense, small items are not really small and they contain a complex set of knowledge.",所以我觉得小的东西其实并不是很小的，它其实蕴含了很多大的这个学问在里面。
Let’s turn our topic from foreign kettle to Chinese lake.,那么从水壶讲到我们中国的湖。
"Lake is a must for a traditional Chinese garden, which is a miniature of the “heaven and earth”.",我们中国的园林它其实叫湖中天地，就一个小小的园林里面，能够把天地的东西摆进去。
Traditional Chinese garden features a design philosophy of “seeing a bigger picture through the small”.,我们讲中国的园林最大的特点：小中见大。
It usually covers an area of several mu and contains dwellings and pavilions.,小小的一个园林，一般几亩地，里面居住对吧，那个呃休息的园林什么都在里头。
What’s special about it?,它是通过什么呢？
"It is its mysterious and enchanting spatial layout of multi-layered hills, flowing streams, exquisite bridges, winding corridors, as well as many walls, window openings and moon gates.",通过我用的对景、用它的构图、用叠山理水，让那个弯弯曲曲的桥，弯弯曲曲的廊子，还有很多的墙、很多窗洞、月洞门等等，把那个空间做得扑朔迷离。
"According to traditional Chinese culture, garden falls into the category of tool.",而且按照我们中国人的这个习惯，那个园林其实是一种器，对吧。
"As the saying in the Book of Changes goes, “What is above form is called Dao; what is under form is called a tool.”",我们《周易》里面讲：“形而之上谓之道，形而之下谓之器。”
How is this “tool” associated with Dao?,那么这么一个器，它怎么跟“道”联系在一起呢？
"Apart from being a tool, Chinese garden also symbolizes the philosophy of Dao.",其实我们的这个园林除了器的作用之外，它还有大的那种“道”的那种概念在里头。
Let me tell you a story.,举个讲个故事。
It’s about the famous philosopher Zhuangzi.,大家都知道庄子。
"One day, Zhuangzi followed his friend Huizi to a lucid river.",庄子有一天跟他的朋友惠子一起跑到一个好水边上。
"Seeing some fish in the river, Zhuangzi said to Huizi, “How happy the fish are in the river.”",那个庄子呢看见水里面的鱼在游，他就告诉那个惠子，他说你看“那个水里面的鱼很快乐。”
"And Huizi questioned, “How do you know they are happy now that you’re not fish?”",那么那个惠子他说“你不是鱼，你怎么知道这个鱼快乐？”
"Zhuangzi argued, “How do you know that I don’t know it now that you’re not me?”",然后庄子呢就说“你不是我，你怎么知道我不知道鱼这个快乐？”
Their dialogue concerns logic and philosophy.,这里面当然有逻辑、有哲学的。
"Influenced by that story, traditional Chinese gardens today, like Yu Garden, usually feature a fish-appreciation pavilion.",所以我们很多的园林里面现在都有一个，你去看像豫园，它有一个知鱼亭，很多地方要知鱼，建鱼乐轩等等。
That is how an ancient philosophical story is put into Chinese gardens.,就是什么呢？就把这样一个故事放到园林里面去了。
"So, small as it may be, a traditional Chinese garden contains profound implications.",所以我们中国的这个园林里面蕴涵了很多丰富的内涵在这个小小的这个园林里面。
Take the Master-of-Nets Garden in Suzhou as an example.,像这是网师园。
"This exquisite garden only covers an area of 8 mu but it contains many structures, including dwellings.",可以说是非常精致的一个园林，一共才八亩，连居住的东西都在里面了。
"And the Ming Dynasty-style garden court at the Met, New York was modeled on a courtyard of that garden.",但是在美国那个大都纽约大都会博物馆搞了一个明轩就是把这个园林搬过去的。
"Thus you can see, traditional Chinese gardens are culture-loaded, built on the philosophy of “following the law of nature and the Creator.”",啊所以我们的这个园林里面还包括了很多的这个概念，它其实呢是把那个造自然之性，那个造化之道，呃有这样一种概念然后把那个很多的思想放到里面。
"As an old Chinese saying goes, “The wise find pleasure in water; the virtuous find pleasure in hills.”",我们中国不是有句古话呃“知者乐水，仁者乐山”。
"And a traditional Chinese garden, with a lake symbolizing the “heaven and earth”, has it all.",所以我们那个园林里面有山有水什么都有，就是把一个小小的那个这么样一个湖中天地，把它的内涵放了非常之大。
"There is also another old Chinese saying that “A straw shows which way the wind blows”, meaning from a small clue one can see what is coming.",中国还有一句古话叫见微见微知著，也是就从小小的东西你可以看到很多。
"This view was initially proposed by Zhu Xi, a philosopher in the Song Dynasty.",这里面讲的就是那个是宋代的思想家朱熹。
"One day, when he was reading, he saw a pond.",他在读书的时候突然想到一个东西，他看到一个水。
And it suddenly occurred to him that “There lies a glassy oblong pool. Where light and shade pursue their course. How could it be so clear and cool? For fresh water comes from the source.”,他说半亩方塘一鉴开，天光云影共徘徊，问渠哪得清如许，为有源头活水来。
"In other words, to keep your mind clear, you should keep refreshing it with new thoughts so that it can keep pace with the times.",就是说你要保持人的心地澄明，你要不断地把很多的思那个思想补充进去，使得自己的思想也不断地在进步。
"The little pond, no more than half mu, about 300 square meters, inspired Zhu Xi.",就是从小小的水塘里面，半亩，大概就是三百多平方米的这个水面。
"Similarly, Laozi used to say, “Small the ‘Dao’ may be, nothing in the world can transcend it or force it to subjection. ”",然后老子有一句话，朴虽小，天地不能臣也，就是说它这个朴，这个道虽然之小啊，但是没有人能够超越它，所以小的东西能够体现很多的内容。
Chinese people prefer everything that is big.,中国人当然喜欢大。
"According to Xu Shen’s Shuowen Jiezi,  the Chinese character for “beauty” consists of two characters, namely, “sheep” and “big”.",我们的美字，对吧，按照许慎的那个《说文解字》，说这个美就是羊大。
So a big sheep was deemed beautiful by ancient Chinese.,羊大为美，一头羊很肥很大，对吧。
"But in fact, the big in the eyes of Chinese comprises a diversity of the small.",但是中国人对那个大呢，里面其实有很多的小的内涵在里面了，对吧。
"According to  Laozi, the greatest sound seems soundless; the greatest image seems formless; the greatest perfection seems imperfect, and yet its use is inexhaustible; the greatest fullness seems empty, and yet its use is endless; the greatest straightness seems twisted; the greatest intelligence seems stupid; the great eloquence seems awkward.",比方说呃我们讲的那个大音希声，大象无形，对吧，大成若缺，呃其用不弊，对吧，大盈若冲，其用不穷，对吧，我们讲那个大智若愚，对吧，大直若屈，大巧若拙，呃还有那个就是大辩如讷，对吧。
"Such words are not just about the big, but also but the small.",这等等的东西，其实它讲的是小的一面，不是仅仅讲的大的一面。
But today we are too obsessive about being big.,但是我们现在太多的喜欢大手笔，对吧。
"In urban construction, we want big budgets, big lawns and big squares.",我们城市建设要大手笔、大草坪、大广场，对吧。
"This is the municipal government building of Tai’an, whose Party secretary told me that it was his design.",这是泰安的一个呃那个市政府大楼，我碰到那个市呃市政府的那个书记，他说这个广场是我设计的。
He just asked his assistant to hold a little flag to help him mapping.,让那个人拿着旗子，这边大一点小一点，对吧，他自己来做。
We all know poet Du Fu’s famous verse that “I must ascend the mountain's crest; it dwarfs all peaks under my feet.”,我们知都大家都知道那个杜甫有一句诗，对吧，会当凌雀绝顶，一览众山小。
"Now, it seems that many people don’t have to ascend the Mount Tai to dwarf all peaks.",但是现在变成我不用到那个泰山顶上也能够看把泰山也看小了。对吧。
"Many of us prefer everything that’s big, such as big-budget movie, big and grand narrative and big academic perspective.",我们现在喜欢大手笔，对吧，然后那个我们的电影要大制作，那个写作文呃写作品要大叙事，对吧，写论文要大框架。
So much so that they ignore the small and overestimate themselves.,都喜欢大，都已经把小忘掉了，都把自己看得也太大了。
Where is it?,这是个什么地方？
"Meishan, hometown to Su Dongpo.",是一个苏东坡的故乡：眉山。
I went there years ago.,我前几年去。
"It’s a small city with a population of 200 to 300 thousand, but it had a 100 meters wide broadway without much traffic.",一个小小的二三十万人的城市搞了一百米宽的这个大路。
"In the middle of the broadway, there was a pavilion for real estate promotion. How ridiculous!",然后呢在大路中间，现在因为没有用没那么多车，做起房地产的广告，售楼处放在那儿去了，对吧。
"We seem to believe the bigger, the better.",我们现在就是大家都喜欢变得很大。
"Last time when I was in Chongqing, I felt the Yangtze River became smaller. Why?",我那年到重庆去，嗯重庆我看怎么怎么那个长江变小啦。
‘Cause the city was getting bigger.,因为城市变大啦。
"With skyscrapers erecting everywhere, the Yangtze River and the Jialing River of course looked smaller.",都是高楼大厦，对吧，嘉陵江变小了、长江变小了。

It’s the Tiananmen Square in Beijing.,北京天安门呐广场对吧。
"And there are the Great Hall of the People, National Center for the Performing Arts, and so on, all big and grand.",那个人民大会堂，还有那个国家大剧院，我们都要叫大剧院不是叫小剧院，对吧。
That reminds me of a story.,然后那个这里面是有一个故事。

He was very rigorous in design.,他做那个设计非常严谨。
We all looked up to him with reverence and nicknamed him “resilient surface”.,所以我们学生呢都非常敬畏的又非常尊敬地叫他“弹力面”。
He was full of momentum when modifying drawings.,他改图的时候很有气势。
"When he was given a fine pencil, he would immediately throw it away.",你给他一支细细的这个笔他就丢掉。
"He preferred 6B, a thick and long one.",他一定要6b铅笔很粗的很长的才能够给你改图。
"When he was modifying a drawing, he was always encircled by many students. Some even stood on stools to see more clearly.",然后他改图的时候呢学生们站在里三圈外三圈站在那个凳子上看。
He was indeed a man with high standards.,他确实有很多想法。
"The Great Hall of the People was designed by his student, who showed him around it in 1961.",那么他的学生设计了人民大会堂，他1961年跑到人民大会堂去，那个学生陪了他参观。
"He said, “You seem to have forgotten all the skills I taught you. You went too far.”",他说你呀把我教你的那个我教给你的skill都忘掉了，怎么可以这样子做。
"When he returned, he did a presentation, arguing the hall was big, but not great.",然后他回来做了一次报告，他说：是巨大不是伟大。

It wasn’t because my English or Dutch wasn’t good enough.,并不是因为我的语言不行，英文还是荷兰文。

Are you willing to step out and try something new and become a lively effervescent tablet?,能敢于去尝试一些从未尝试过的事物，能让你自己从这个管子里面的泡腾片走出来，变成一个活生生的，有生命力的泡腾片？

"There is a small country called Spain in Europe, and of course its people speak Spanish.",在欧洲有一个很小的国家叫西班牙，那么西班牙人们自然是讲西班牙语。
"However, there is a notably large group of people on the American continents speaking spanish as well.",但是在美洲大陆有一大片土地上人们也在讲西班牙语。
Why is that?,那么这是为什么？
This is attributable to one famous navigator Cristoforo Colombo who lived about 500 years ago.,这是因为在五百多年以前，在欧洲出现了一个著名的航海家叫哥伦布。
"There is no doubt that Cristoforo Colombo was a farsighted explorer, for while people in his times believed that the earth was a flat disc, Cristoforo Colombo believed it was a round sphere.",应该说在当时的年代，哥伦布毫无疑问是个顶尖的科学探险家，因为当时绝大多数人还相信这个地球是平的，但哥伦布坚信这个地球一定是圆的。
"In 1492, 520 years ago from now, Cristoforo, together with other 84 sailors, left Spain on 3 ships for the Atlantic without any hesitation. Each ship was as small as 17 meters in length.",于是在1492年的时候，离现在520年，他带领了84个人，驾驶着3艘小船，真的是很小的船，这个船有多小，只有17米，他带领了84个人，义无反顾地向西边驶进了大西洋。
"Cristoforo was convinced that he would reach the ancient oriental countries, namely, India and China, if he kept sailing westward.",因为他坚信一直向西航行，就能够发现当时的东方古国，印度和中国。
"70 days later, he came ashore on a vast continent that he believed to be India.",结果七十天之后，他来到了一片很大的大陆，他以为是到了印度，
"Actually, it was a new continent.",其实他是发现了新大陆。
"There is also a well-known Chinese navigator in the Ming dynasty, Zheng He, who was as adventurous as Cristoforo.",跟哥伦布相比，其实我们中国也有一个著名的航海家，大家都知道他叫郑和。
He was born 87 years earlier than Colombo.,跟哥伦布相比，郑和其实比哥伦布早出生了87年。
Zheng He led 7 ocean expeditions into the southeast Asia in his lifetime.,郑和一生七次下南洋。
"Java, which is Indonesia now, was the farthest place his fleets had reached.",最远的时候到达了现在印度尼西亚的爪哇。
"Unlike Colombo, Zheng He commanded quites a colossal fleet of over 100 ships in his prime.",应该说跟哥伦布相比，郑和的船队在鼎盛的时候是浩浩荡荡的，一百多艘船。
The largest one was up to 125 meters in length.,最大的船125米。
How many sailors were there in his fleet?,有多少人？
"27,800 in total.",有27800人。
"When re-examining Zheng He's navigation routes, we can find that he basically led his fleets along coastal lines or back and forth in enclosed seas.",但是我们再看他的航行路线，基本上都是沿着海岸线或者在内海里走来走去。
"Regratbly, Zheng He didn't sail further southward, as Java is not far away from today's Darwin, the northernmost city of Australia.",应该说非常遗憾，爪哇离现在的澳大利亚的最北端的城市达尔文，相距已经真的不远了。
Let's come back and take a second look at the map.,再回到这张地图，再看欧洲。
"There is a tiny country in Europe, England.",还有另外一个不大的国家叫英国。
"Of course, the people in England speak English.",那么在英国，毫无疑问人们也是讲英语的。
But why there are so many people across the world speaking English as well?,但是除了英国，为什么全世界那么多的地方，那么多的人也在英语？
"Let's not rush to discuss why the people in two major countries in North America, the USA and Canada, and some small countries in Africa, speak English.",我们暂且不说北美洲有两个大国，美国和加拿大为什么讲英语，我们也不说为什么非洲有一些小国讲英语。
"Instead, let's take a look at why do Australians and New Zealanders speak English.",我们先来看一看，为什么在澳大利亚和新西兰，人们讲英语。
"This is because of a navigator from England about 200 years ago, James Cook.",这是因为就在200多年以前在英国也出现了一个航海家，这个人的名字叫库克。
It's fair to say that James was also a top explorer for he made the most comprehensive coast chart in his times.,应该说在当时的年代，库克也是一位顶尖的科学探险家，因为他做的海岸图在当时的年代是全世界最顶尖的。
James completed his voyages with only a medium-sized ship that was once used for coal shipment in the North Sea.,库克也用了一艘不大的船，而且这艘船来自于哪里？来自于北海的一艘运煤的船。
He first arrived at South America with this ship.,他先是驾驶着这艘船，先是到了南美洲。
After a short break he continued his voyage further southward with a firm belief in mind that there may be big islands or even continents.,稍事休息之后没有停顿，因为当时他就坚信在南美洲再往南，很可能还有非常大的岛屿甚至可能有大陆板块儿。
"Then he found Haiti, New Zealand and then Australia.",他到了海地，那么后来发现了新西兰，随后又发现了澳大利亚。
How long ago was this?,这是在多长时间以前的事情？
Over 240 years ago.,240多年以前。
"Let's look at a renowned archipelago, Malvinas.",再看一个岛屿，非常有名气，叫做马岛。
"Actually, it has two names, the Falkland Islands and Malvinas Islands.",它其实有两个名字，一个叫福克兰群岛，另一个叫马尔维纳斯群岛。
The islands bear witness to a notorious war called the Malvinas War that happened exactly 30 years ago.,都知道，刚好就是在30年以前，曾经发生过一场著名的战争，就叫马岛之战。
It is a war over sovereignty.,它是一个关于主权的战争。
Argentina claimed sovereignty over this island on the ground that they are close to each other.,因为这个岛屿距离阿根廷很近，所以阿根廷说这个岛屿应该是属于我的。
"Actually, it was first found by a British captain in 1690.",但实际上这个岛屿最开始是被一个英国的船长发现的，当时是1690年。
"According to relevant international convention, the sovereign of the island shall belong to whoever discovered it first.",按照国际公约，谁先发现的其实就应该属于谁。
"In recent decades, there have been many adventurers cropping up in China.",呃，最近几十年，在中国也开始出现了科学探险家。
Almost all of them are members of China Association for Scientific Expedition.,而且这些科学探险家几乎都云集于中国科学探险协会。
Here are some examples.,我想举几个例子。
In 2004 and 2005 when China started to build the Great Wall Station at the South Pole.,04年、05年的时候我们国家开始在南极建长城站。
"About 590 people were dispatched there under the leadership of Guo Kun, one of the earliest leaders of China Association for Scientific Expedition.",当时去了590多人，而这590多人的领导、领袖、带头人就是郭琨先生，郭琨先生就是中国科学探险协会最早的领袖之一。
"Now let's talk about professor Qin Dahe, who you may be very familiar with.",我们再说一下秦大河教授，这个名字大家应该很熟悉。
"In 1987 and 1988, 6 top scientists from 6 countries decided to walk across the South Pole, including Qin Dahe, a top glaciologist .",87、88年的时候全世界6个国家的6个顶尖的科学家他们决定徒步地穿越南极，其中就包括中国的秦大河教授，他是一个顶尖的冰川学家。
"The 6 scientists spent 220 days walking over 6000 kilometers, collecting a large amount of glacier samples.",这6个科学家，他们历时220天，徒步穿越了将近6000公里，采了大量的冰川的雪样。
Suffice it to say that this journey is a magnificent feat in science.,应该说这是一次举世著名的壮举。
"Professor Gao Dengyi, the leader of the association, is the first scientist who has set foot at the South Pole, the North Pole, the Mount Everest and the worl's deepest canyon, Yarlung Zangbu Grand Canyon.",我们再来看高登义教授，他是我们协会现在的主席，他是第一个到过南极、北极、珠峰和最深的大峡谷雅鲁藏布大峡谷的科学家。
"In addition, he is an atmospheric physicist who spearheaded the research of the North Pole in China.",他也是中国最早的研究北极的大气物理学家。
"He has conquered all the four poles in the world, namely the South Pole, the North Pole, the Mount Everest and Yarlung Zangbu Grand Canyon.",我们知道全世界只有四极，南极、北极、珠峰和大峡谷，他都到过。
"Since its founding, China Association for Scientific Expedition has initiated several large scientific research activities at home and abroad.",中国科学探险协会从创建到现在做了很多的大型的科考活动，包括在国内也包括在国外。
"Their presence was seen in places of China such as the Mount Everest, Yarlung Zangbu Grand Canyon, Hoh Xil, the source of Yangtz River, Yellow River and Lantsang, and Takla Makan Desert, and exotic lands, including the South Pole, the North Pole, the Great Rift Valley, Amazon, etc.",在国内的，包括珠峰、包括雅鲁藏布大峡谷、包括可可西里、包括三江源头，包括很多很多地方，塔克拉玛干等等；那么在国外，包括南极、北极、东非大裂谷、亚马逊等等。
"Most notably, in its expeditions of 1993 and 1994, China Association for Scientific Expedition found that Yarlung Zangbu Grand Canyon is the deepest canyon in the world.",最值得一提的是93年、94年的时候，中国科学探险协会在考察雅鲁藏布大峡谷的时候，发现这才是全世界最深的大峡谷。
"Before that, the Grand Canyon Colorado was believed, according to many geography books, to be the deepest canyon in the world.",而在此之前，全世界的地理书、地理教科书都说美国的科罗拉多是全世界的最深大峡谷。
The significant finding by the association has renewed our knowledge of the deepest canyon in the world.,所以我们看，这是非常重要的一个发现，改变了全世界关于最深的大峡谷的地理认知。
"Personally, I think China Association for scientific Expedition, along with its top members and significant findings, will make their way into the ""hall of fame"" eventually.",所以我个人认为中国科学探险协会，一批顶尖的科学探险家以及它的一些重要的发现将是载入史册的。
"In fact, scientific expedition tends to be overlooked in traditional education system of China.",呃其实，在中国的传统教育里，科学探险是一个非常被忽视的元素。
Some of you may still remember some Janpanese and Chinese students went on an exploratory tour in the grassland of Inner Mongolia in 1992.,有些朋友可能会知道92年的时候，一些日本的中学生到中国和中国的中学生一起到内蒙的草原上做探险旅游。
"The 20-kilometer-long trip brought out a tenacious quality of the Japanese students, who were in stark contrast to the sluggish Chinese students.",结果，20公里下来，日本的孩子们表现得非常的顽强，而中国很多的孩子们表现得没那么顽强。
"Then, an accompanying correspondent wrote an article titled The Competition on the Summer Camp, attracting nationwide attention.",于是一个随行的记者写了一篇文章叫做《夏令营中的较量》，这篇文章在当时引起了全社会广泛的关注。
Now two decades have passed.,那么整整二十年过去了。
Has our quality education improved?,我们的素质教育真的有所改善吗？
I personally don't think so.,我个人不太认为。
"One year ago in Shanghai, an outstanding student from a top middle school took his own life at the time of the college entrance examination.",一年多以前就在上海，一个非常顶尖的中学，一个学习成绩非常好的孩子，在高考的时候，轻生了。
Why?,为什么呢？
"Because he thought he could be admitted into Tsinghua University solely on recommendation, only to find that was just a daydream.",因为他期望能够被保送进清华，结果他的愿望没有实现。
This kid must be an extraordinary student.,这孩子学习一定非常好。
"He was a leader in his class, and had won awards in various competetions.",他是班干，也在不同的大赛里获过大奖。
But he's gone.,但是今天他不在了。
"More than a decade ago, I drove to the Grand Canyon Colorado when I was on an academic visit in America.",十多年以前，我在美国访学的时候，专门儿开车去了美国的科罗拉多大峡谷。
"Standing at the edge of the canyon and admiring the colorful geologic layers, I couldn't help but think that I was so insignificant when compared with the canyon's magnificent height and millions years of history.",站在峡谷的边缘，望着对面一层一层五颜六色的地质结构，我真的感叹自己太渺小了，因为我们能看到的是将近上千米的高度，上亿年的历史。
"If this kid had the same kind of experience of recognizing the insignificance of a human being, he would not mind whether he was enrolled by Peking University, Tsinghua University or East China Normal University, my Alma Mater.",所以想象一下，如果这个轻生的孩子能够曾经像我这样，拥有这样的经历，感受到我们自身的渺小的话，他可能真的不会介意是去北大、清华，还是甚至去我们华东师大。
"As China's influence multiplies across the world, more and more people, the young generation particularly, backpacked their way into the wild.",最近几年随着国富民强，呃越来越多的人，尤其是一些青年人开始走出家门，成为驴友。
"However, tragedies occur every now and then.",但是这中间呢也出现了一些状况。
"In 2002, 5 students from Peking University who loved climbing mountains were found dead in Tibet.",我们知道，02年的时候有五个非常优秀的北大的学生，他们是登山爱好者，他们永远地留在了西藏。
The tragedy happened when they were climbing the 14th highest mountain in the world.,他们在攀登全世界第十四大高峰的时候，出了山难。
They were forever buried there.,永远地留在了那里。
"Actually, there is another incident a year ago you may be familiar with.",其实就在一年多以前，又发生另外一件事情，我想大家可能也很熟悉。
It happened  in the Mount Huangshan.,就是黄山事件。
A local policeman gave his life when he was searching for students lost in the mountain.,一个当地的警察在去黄山寻找迷路的学生的时候，牺牲了。
"On March 18, another tragedy happened in the Eighteen Streams, a scenic area in Fujian Province.",就在本月3.18号，在福建省一个叫十八重溪的地方，又发生了一起山难。
One 28-year-old young man lost his life.,一个年轻人只有28岁，再也回不来了。
"If we reflect on those incidents, or tragedies, we can see that they happened for a reason.",那么我们反思一下这些事件，或者山难，其实都是有原因的。
Take the incident of the Peking University students as an example.,比如说山鹰折翅事件，他们当时登山是选择了暑假，因为没办法。
"They were only free on summer vacation, while in fact it was a bad time for climbing.",他们只有在暑假有时间，但是暑假是不适宜登山的季节。
And in the case of the incident in Mount Huangshan.,我们再说这个黄山事件。
"The students dropped their GPS in the water during climbing, what's worse, it started to rain.",当时学生们在登山的时候，他们带的GPS掉到了水里，而且当时的天气也不好，已经开始下雨。
In that situation they should have get off the car.,所以这时候他们唯一的选择其实是应该下车。
"As for the incident in the Eighteen Streams, it was mostly due to the recklessness.",我们再看这个十八重溪山难，更多的是因为鲁莽。
"Eighteen Streams is hard to walk through even in the daytime and no one in that team had ever managed to walk through that area before, not to mention that the tragedy happened during midnight.",因为当时他们发生山难的时候已经是半夜了，十八重溪这个地方即便是在白天也是非常难穿越的，而且他们整个队伍中没有一个人在此之前真正地穿越过十八重溪。
That's why I see their trip as an unscientific adventure rathern than a scientific expedition.,所以我说，他们不是在做科学探险，而是在做非科学的冒险。
"Considering those tragedies, China Association for Scientific Expedition led some top students in Beijing's A-list middle schools to the South Pole, the North Pole and Mount Everest in the past several years.",基于以上这些原因，中国科学探险协会最近这些年开始组织北京一些顶尖的中学的一些最优秀的中学生，带他们去南极、北极和珠峰。
"In this year, I bring this project to Shanghai.",那么今年我把这个项目带到了上海。
"So far, there have been over 200 students who have set foot in the South Pole, the North Pole and Mount Everest under the guidance of the association.",迄今为止，已经有两百多个学生，在我们协会的带领下去过南极、北极和珠峰。
"Among them, some have won the first prize in innovation contests with their academic articles, and others have been enrolled by MIT or Stanford because of this experience.",这里边有的学生，他的论文获得了创新大赛一等奖，有的学生因为有这么好的经历，在去美国的麻省理工学院、斯坦福的时候被破格地录取了。
"Recently, I have been promoting a league named ""Scientific Outdoor League for College Students"".",最近我本人在积极地推动一个联盟，这个联盟的名字叫做“大学生科学户外联盟”。
"In spite of the numerous school associations for outdoor activities, many kids are still unclear of how to conduct outdoor activities.",因为中国目前很多的学校都有这种户外的社团，但是孩子们真的不是特别清楚我们该怎么去玩儿户外。
So I spend many time explaining to them that outdoor activities shall be scientifically guided.,所以我就跟他们去讲，同学们，我们到户外去不仅仅应该满足于到此一游。
"Cursory glance or intentional adventure are neither scientific, nor wise.",也更不要故意去冒险，我们应该在科学的指导下做有科学内涵的户外活动。
Look at this map and set free your imagination.,再回到这张地图，我们想象一下。
"What would it be like if Zheng He were as brave as Colombo to sail across the Pacific, or he had more luck to continue his voyage further southward after reaching Java?",如果当年郑和先生能像哥伦布勇敢地穿越大西洋一样穿越了太平洋，或者哪怕他的运气稍微好那么一点点，到了爪哇的时候继续往南走？
We may not need Visa if we travel to the America continent or Australia.,那么很可能今天我们去整个美洲大陆或者澳洲的时候就不需要办签证了。
"If the student who had committed suicide had a chance to know Mother Nature to hone his spirit, he would have been studying at a top university right now.",再想象一下我们那个轻生的中学生，如果他不仅学习好，而且在他年轻的生命过程中走进了大自然，意志变得很坚强的话，或许此时此刻，他就在某一个顶尖的大学的教室里复习功课呢。
"Those people who had lost their lives in the mountains would also have been sitting among us right now, if they had conducted a scientific expedition rather than an unscientific adventure.",那么再想象一下，那些在山难中永远消失的生命，如果他们做的是科学探险而不是非科学的冒险的话，那么也有可能他们此时此刻就跟你我在一起谈经论道。
"As a saying goes, ""In order to attain wisdom, it is not enough merely to read books, you must be well-travelled as well.""",读万卷书，行万里路。
This is what scientific expeditions are for.,这就是科学探险为什么。
Thanks!,谢谢大家！
"So this is our last stop, and we came back to our headquarter in Beijing.",啊额最后一站了，然后回到了大本营北京。
I am very excited to have such a large and enthusiastic audience like you guys.,然后额看到这么满的人确实也是很激动的，就是大家实在是太热情了。
So you have just now learned a bit about our speech technology.,额然后呢，实际上刚才看到就是咱们前面语音技术介绍了很多。
" In fact, what we offer is a technology that converts speech, namely what we say, into text.",也就是说实际上都是在介就是都是在额就是给大家提供一个什么呢，就是把我们的一个文字，就是我们说出来的话转化成文字这样一个技术。
My job is actually to support the voice technology.,而我这边呢，实际上是在语音的背后，我们一直默默的在后面。
"What we need to do, is to figure out a proprer way to interpret the information that a text conveys so that the machine could truly understand the meaning of the text.",然后我们要解决的是什么，就是说这一段文字里面的一些内容怎么去对它进行一个适当的理解，让机器真正能够听懂这个文字里面所表达的含义。
"So my topic today is ""UNIT Language Understanding and Interaction Technology"".",所以呢，我今天的这个题目就是“UNIT语言理解与交互技术”。
"First, let us recall a bit, what is AI?",然后我们先来回顾一下，额AI到底是什么？
It is actually quite simple. ,实际上很简单。
The concept of AI was proposed as early as in 1960s. ,我们从上世纪60年代开始呢就已经提出来AI这样的一个概念。
"Since then, scientists and IT engineers have been working relentlessly to achieve one thing, that is, to empower a machine with the capabilities of a human.",这么几十年以来前赴后继的，实际上我们一直科学家和计算机工程师们一直在孜孜额额额一直在就是那个努力地去做的这样的一件事情——就是让机器拥有一个人的能力。
So what human capacities we expect from the machine?,那么他需要让，我们希望让机器拥有怎么样人的能力呢？
"As presented before, first we need the voice capability. ",首先就是刚才咱们介绍的，我们要有语音的能力。
We need the machine to listen and to talk.,我们要让就是机器人能够能听会说。
"Apart from that, we need the ability to recogize images. ",然后除此之外呢，我们要有识图像的能力。
"As I mentioned, the machine need to recognize people and draw a certain images as well.",刚才也介绍过了，它能够看懂人，同时也能画出一些确定的一些图像来。
It should also have the language competence that enables it to understand the language，i.e. to understand the actural meaning behind it.,然后其次呢，它就要有语言的能力，它语言的能力是让机器能够去理解这个语言，就是这个语言背后的一些实际的含义。
"Finally, we expect that the machine have the ability to act, that it can excecute some operations autonomously.",然后最后呢，我们是期望让机器拥有这样一个行动的能力，它能够去自主地去做一些执行一些操作。
"On top of that, we wish that the machine would be able to think, that it could think and reason as human do.",然后再更深的一层次呢，我们实际上是期望让诶机器能够拥有首先拥有思考的能力，它能够去像我们人类一样去思维、去推理。
"In addition, we hope that the machine could acquire knowledge, for instance, it should be able to accumulate knowledage and use it during the process of thinking, just as humans do.",除此之外呢，我们期望让机器拥有知识，比如说它能够额像我们人类一样，我们有大量的一些知识的积累，而且呢能够把它应用到我们的整个思考中。
"Then, the last yet very important capacity that we expect from the machine is self-learning.",当然其次最后我们还需要让机器拥有一个非常重要的就是自己学习的能力。
"Among all these capacities, I'd like to focus on the language capacity.",那么这些能力中间呢实际上我今天会重点给大家介绍一下语言方面的能力。
"First, why do we invest so much in language-related AI technologies?",我们先来看一下，我们为什么就是说那个大家一直以来都是在额投入了很多的力量在做语言相关的一些人工智能的技术呢？
Because we believe that language is the carrier of our thoughts and knowledge.,实际上最核心的问题是我们认为语言是思维和知识的这么样一个载体。
Why is language considered the carrier of thoughts?,为什么说语言是思维的载体？
Think about it and we will find out that many of our thoughts and expressions are eventually delivered in the form of language.,其实大家可以想象一下就是包括我们现在我们的很多的思考、我们的很多的表达其实最终都是通过语言的形式来体现出来的。
"Just like now, I am giving my presentation through language to express my thoughts.",所以它实际上包括现在在给大家在做一些相关的报告我也是通过语言的方式来传递我的思维的。
"Apart from that, we believe that language encodes knowledge and is the carrier to pass it on.",那么其除此之外呢，我们实际上认为语言是知识的凝练和传承的载体。
"Now, let's have a look at these pictures, they show the evolution of language from the Jiahu symbols in ancient times, then oracle bone script, to Internet images and texts of today.",大家也可以看一下这样一些图，额从最远古时期的贾湖刻符，然后到甲骨文再一路演化到现在的这样一个互联网图文。
The form that carries knowledge changes and updates constantly. ,知识承载的形式一直都在变化，而且在不断地升级。
We will have even more forms in the future.,甚至接下来我们可能还会有更多的这样的一些承载的形式。
But what does not change? Language doesn’t.,但是这其中唯一不变的是什么？是语言。
Language enables us to understand knowledge. ,它使得我们能够理解我们的知识。
"We have a 5,000-year culture.",我们有五千年的文化。
"There are cultures that stretch even longer time, passing on over thousands of years dispite all sorts of obstacles.",所以说我们有更长更长时间的这样一些文化，能够一路地跨越这几千年的屏障一路传递到现在。
  The messages recorded by those languages may probably be the same.,它们里面记录的内容也许都是一样的。
So we believe that language is crucial to AI.,所以我们可以认为就是语言是人工智能里面非常重要的一环。
Then what do we expect in the modern era?,那么在今天这样的一个时代，我们期望做一些什么样的事情？
"Actually, we have entered the era of AI, and we expect language to play an important role here.",实际上，我们已经进入了这样的一个就是额人工智能的时代，当然我们是期望让语言在这里面能扮演一个非常重要的角色。
What role is it?,那么什么样的一个角色呢？
"Over the past years, we have proposed the concept of ""Dialogue as a Platform"".",实际上近几年来，我们一直提出来这样一个所谓的“对话即平台”的这样的一个概念。
"That is, we expect to interact directly with a machine through dialogue, enabling the machine to understand what we say, and say what we expect from it.",而这里面实际上就是期望我们通过对话的形式直接去与机器进行交互，然后让机器能够听懂我们的说的，而且同时让机器能够说出我们所期望它所表达的一些内容。
"Now, let's watch a video.",现在先让我们来看一段视频。
"Xiaodu Xiaodu, how's the weather today?",小度小度，今天天气怎么样？

The function has already been launched. ,额已经上线了。
You can just open Baidu Map and have a try.,大家打开百度地图就能用了啊。
"So, why do I show you this video?",然后这里面，我为什么要放这样的一个视频？
"Actually, it presents a key technology which enables us to conrol a device easily and make it follow the instructions as expected through conversation.",实际上这里面实际上就是体现了一个非常关键的一个技术，就是我们通过对话，我们只需要通过对话，然后我们就可以轻易地去控制我们的这这样的一个就是额这样的一个设备，然后让它去执行所有我们所期望它去执行的一些指令。
"It actually involves capacities such as anaphora resolution, multi-turn dialogue, natural language understanding, and gerneralization of expressions.",这里面实际上包括了有指代的一些消解，然后我们有多轮对话，然后我们有各种的语言上的一些理解，甚至有我各种表达方式的一些泛化。
"These capabilities are actually supported by our core NLP language recognition technology, which is supported by our UNIT platform.",而这样的一些能力实际上都是我们核心的一些NLP识别语言识别的这样的一个技术在起作用，而这个技术实际上也是我们的UNIT平台所支持的。
So these capabilities are available on our UNIT platform.,所以呢其实大家刚才看到的这些能力的话，通过我们UNIT平台大家都可以得到。
"Following the example, let's take a close look at the composition of the dialogue system.",那么看完这样的一个例子以后呢，我们来详细看一下就是对话系统实际上它到底是怎样组成的。
How does the computer generate such a dialogue?,刚才的这样的一个对话，实际上在我们的计算机背后它到底是怎么去做到的。
It simply involves two fields.,很简单，两个大的领域。
The first is voice.,第一个领域是语音。
" When we say a sentence, the ASR module will convert it into a piece of text.",我们说了一句话，然后我们的语音识别模块会把它识别成一段文字。
"Secondly, it goes to the NLP field.",然后接下来呢，实际上就进入到我们NLP这样的一个领域。
"In this field, we use NLU technology to extract some core knowledge of a text, to figure out its intention.",这个领域里面呢，就是我们会通过语言理解的这样一个技术，把这样的一段话里面的一些核心的知识点给它抽取出来，把它的意图给它抽取出来。
"Then, we have dialog state tracking, fusing knowledge in multiple turns of the dialogue to determine the last action based on previous states.",接下来呢，我们要进行一个对话状态的维护，在很多轮对话里面，我们把这些知识进行一个融合，然后通过上面这些状态去把就是我们最后的一个动作筛选出来。
"Next, with a module called NLG, namely natural language generation, we integrate the conversation history,  the information we expect the computer to express and the knowledage we have retrieved, to generate a passage that we expect.",然后，我们通过一个叫做NLG也就是自然语言生成这样的一个模块，我们可以通就是可以把刚才的所有的话，就是我们计算机期望去，我们期望让计算机去表达的一些语言和我们已经检索到的一些知识整体整合起来，然后形成一个我们期望让计算机去表达的一段语言。
"Then, we synthesize the speech through TTS and let the computer speak.",接下来我们通过TTS把它合成，然后让计算机说出。
 This is the composition of a complete dialogue system.,这就是一套完整的对话系统的一个组成。
"Such a system seems quite sophisticated, because it involves many key technologies.",喔，这样的一套组成其实看起来还是蛮复杂的，因为实际上这里面涉及到了很多核心的一些关键技术。
"We have mentioned various voice technologies, including recognition and synthesis.",刚才实际上咱们已经看到了语音的一些各层各各种层面的技术，包括识别的技术和合成的技术。
"As for NLP, you can see that there are many underlying technologies.",然后呢，NLP这里面的话，大家也看到有很多这样的一些底层的技术。
"In fact, more fundamentally, it also relies on some basic lexical analysis as well as massive user behavior data to learning, which enpowers it the capability of fluent conversation and generalization as we have just seen.",其实更底层的时候，它还需要依赖一些基本的词法分析，以及大量的一些还以以及大量的这种就是用户的一些行为、数据去进行学习，才能得到刚才我们看到的这样的一个比较流畅的对话和泛化的能力。
"So as a matter of fact, for a not-so-large R&D team like us, it's rather difficult to imporve these technologies to a state-of-the-art condition.",所以呢，实际上这样的一些技术对于就是我们额没有一个特别庞大的这样一个研发的团队来说的话呢，我们可能是很难能够把它就是做到一个比较完完善的状态。
"But never mind, we have opened the platform.",所以额，但是没有关系，就是我们已经开放了。
"We opened UNIT to solve this problem, to enable our developers to achieve this kind of configurations via our platform.",所以说我们现在把UNIT开放出来呢其实就是为了解决这样的一个问题，替我们广大的开发者能够去让我们广大开发者能够基于我们这样的一个平台，去完成刚才的这样的一些配置。
"All we need to do is to make simple customization on intentions and slots, and provide a training corpus.",我们只需要在这个上面简单去做一些简一些就是意图啊、词槽的一些定制，然后提供一定的训练语料就可以把这样的一个工作给它完成了。
"Now, let's look at the specific supports provided by the platform.",然后那么我们来看一下我们这个平台上具体提供了一些什么样的支持呢。
"Firstly, as mentioned before, we have technologies. ",首先我们刚才讲到了我们有我们的技术。
"Secondly, we have strong capabilities for customization.",然后其次呢我们有强大的一些定制化的能力，然后之后呢。
 We also have massive big data from the real world. ,我们实际上还有我们真实的海量的一些大数据。
All of these are offered as a package on UNIT.,这些整体都打包在UNIT里面去提供给大家。
We wish to open our technologies and apply them to various products.,然后，我们希望的话呢，是我们能够把我们的技术开放出来，然后我们赋能到我们的各个产品里面去。
"Meanwhile, we can work with our developers to jointly create a resonant eco-system.",然后同时呢，能够和我们广大的开发者形成一个生态上的一个共鸣。
This involves two most critical technologies.,这个里面呢，最关键的技术有这么两个大的部分。
" One is NLU, and the other is multi-turn interaction.",第一个部分叫做语言理解的技术，然后第二个部分呢，叫做多轮交互的技术。
"Most importantly, the two critical technologies are supported by our fundamental technologies and data.",然后最核心就是在这两个技术的背后呢实际上是由我们的基础技术和基础数据的一些支撑。
Let's look at the platform in detail. ,然后我们可以来详细看一下。
"Firstly, it provides the ability to understand intentions and slots.",首先我们这个平台上面提供了一个面向意图和词槽的理解能力。
This is actually easy. ,实际上很简单。
"For example, when a user says something which we call it a ""query"", our recognition module will recognize it as an intention of restaurant reservation.",这样的一条用户的表达——query——就是一段文字，然后呢，我们的这个识别模型会把它识别成这是一个预订餐厅的这样一个意图。
"Then, we extract the key information from the query and normalize it, like the name of the restaurant, the reservation time and the number of customers.",接下来呢我们会把这儿里面的一些关键信息抽取出来，而且把它做进行一个归一化，比如说我要知道餐厅名、时间和人数。
"In real scenario like this, users normally would not give all key information to the machine in one go.",然后通常在真实的这样的一个应用环境里面呢，用户不会一口气地把所有的关键要素都说给机器人的。
"For example, when we discuss having a meal together with our friends, we usually do not tell them ""Let's go to Quanjude tonight at 6 p.m."" at once, do we?",包括我们自己跟朋友之间的聚餐的一些商量的过程中，我们也不可能说是一口气就说“今天晚上我们要去全聚德餐厅，六点钟”，对吧？
We tend to express our needs step by step.,我们一般是一步一步地去把自己的需求表达出来的。
 So such a way of expression is actually crucial for us to express our needs.,所以呢，这样的一个这样的一个表达，实际上对于整个就是额我们去表达需求是非常重要的。
"Therefore, it naturally comes down to our multi-turn interaction technology.",然后这就需要用到我们这样一个多轮交互的技术。
"Now, let's look at the example. ",大家可以看一下这个例子。
"""Please reserve a 10-people room at Quanjude for me.""",“帮我订一个全聚德的10人包间”。
"During this process, he actually did not mention the time of reservation.",然后在这个过程中呢，实际上并没有表达就是他想要订什么时候的。
That's OK. ,那OK，没有关系。
"Our machine will automatically ask me ""What time would you like the reservation for?""",我们的机器人会自动地去反问，说“你想订什么时间的？”
OK.,那OK。
" All we need is to say is, ""Well, at 6 p.m."", then it's done.",我们只要表达随着说“哦！今晚6点吧”，那好，就订完了。
"Besides, we can realize a simple extension via the platform, namely recommendation.",然后除此之外呢，我们还可以就是在平台上实现一个简单的延伸的一个需求一个就是推荐。
"For example, it can ask further ""Do you need a taxi at that time to take you there?""",那么比如说我还可以说比如说“你还需要再叫一个那个时间的车吗？”
OK. ,OK。
All we need is a simple configuration on the platform.,我们只需要在上面去配一下。
 Then the system will naturally recommend such a dialogue and guide users to continue customization.,然后它自然地就会把这样一个额对话给你推荐出来，然后引导用户去完成更多的一些部分的定制。
"This and what mentioned on the last page constitute the conversational understanding ability in terms of  intentions and slots, which is the first function we provide on UNIT.",那么这个和上面这一页的东西就组成了我们面向意图、词槽的这样一个对话式理解这样的一个能力，这个能力在UNIT上面是我们最先提供出来的一个能力。
The next comes to a situation encountered by many of our friends.,那么接下来还有一种情况，就我们有很多的额朋友实际上经常会出现这样的一个情况。
"That is, I have actually created a big Q&A dataset.",就是说额我在我自己实际上已经搜集好了一个很很很庞大的一个question & answer 的这样一个这样的一个问答库了。
But I do not intend to build an intention for each of the questions. ,然后呢，我们也不期望对每一个问题去建立一些精确的意图。
All I expect is to pump the Q&A dataset into my system.,我只是期望就是说是我把这个问答库灌到我的系统里面去。
"Then when a new query comes from a user, for instance, about how to apply for these stuff.",然后呢，当用户来了一来了一个就是新的一条query，比如说我想要了解这些都怎么申请。	
Then the platform will automatically find the most semantically similar answers from our dataset and recommend them to the user.,那么就自动地从我们库里面去匹配出一些就是跟他的问题最语义上最相近的这样的一些额答案，然后推荐给用户。
 In this way an intelligent conversation for the purpose of customer services or consulting services is finished.,然后直接就完成这样一个客服类的或者说是咨询类的这样一个就是智能对话。
"Such function is also available on our UNIT platform and was launched at phase II, approximately in September.",那么这个能力的话呢在我们的UNIT上也是自然是支持的，这是我们第二期大概是在九月份的时候上线的一个能力。
"Well, as I just said, all you need to do is to directly pump a  question&answer dataset into our platform and that is it.",嗯，然后就像我刚才说的，大家只需要把这样的一个question & answer的这样的一些资料直接灌到我们平台上面去就结束了。
"Then, after the platform receives some generalized questions from users, it will automatically search for answers in the pool, and finds the most pertinent answers for us.",然后接下来的话，你的一些相关的一些就是问用户的一些泛化性的一些问题直接问过来以后，它就会自动地去在这里面去检索，然后帮我们把一些最相关的一些就是一些结果呢检索出来。
"Similarly, a question & answer dataset in the category of customer service actually need multi-turn dialogue data.",同样的，额一个客服类的一个问答知识库实际上它它也是需要多轮的。
" This is because when users ask questions, they usually don't know what they really expect.",因为用用户过来的时候，他有时候其实根本不了解自己到底需要什么。
"For example, a user expects to know about the loan application process, but he doesn't know what kind of loans we offer.",比如说，用户刚过来的时候他只是想了解一下怎么贷款，他不知道你有什么产品。
That's OK. ,那OK。
We actually need to guide him step by step with a multi-turn conversation. ,我们实际上是需要去通过多轮的方式去一点一点去引导。
"After completed the conversation, we recommend a result to the user.",然后完成这样的一个对话，最后把这样的一个结果推荐给用户的。
Such capabilities are also available on our platform.,而这样的一些能力的话，同样的也在我们平台上面提供出来了。
So we simply need to integrate the multi-turn conversation mechanism with the question & answer mechanism in order to complete a dialogue of this kind.,所以大家是需要去用我们的整个多轮对话的机制和我们的就是问答的这样一个机制，把它额简单地给它拼接起来，拼接起来以后实际上就可以完成这样一个类型的对话。
"As I mentioned before, the above-mentioned two capabilities are our two different solutions for a smart dialogue scenario.",那么刚才已经提到了，就是前面两种是我们面对就是额智能对话的这样一个场景的话提供的两种类不同类型的这样一些解决的一些能力。
"However, such capabilities actually are not fixed, but can be customized according to domain knowledge provided, logic of interaction and via model training. ",然后呢，这样的一些能力实际上并不是说我们一成不变地就提供出来了，而是说我实际上是可以通过我们提供的领域知识、交互逻辑和模型训练的这样一定制化能力去咱们可以自助地去去定义好。
Users can then train their own models according to their business requirements.,然后可以去就是去训练出一些自己的就是自己业务所需要的这样一些模型的。
These models can in fact be customized on the UNIT platform.,而这些模型的话，实际上都是可以在这个UNIT平台上面完成这样一些定制。
"Although we just opened the UNIT to the public in July this year, we have been operating it in Baidu for quite a long time.",额，UNIT平台虽然说实际上我们是今年七月份的时候才刚刚对外发布，但是呢，实际上在百度内部我们已经积累了非常长的时间了。
"So we have been accumulating some experience in different scenarios, such as smart customer services, assistants, household appliances, vehicle systems and robots.",而这样，额我们实际上已经在包括智能客服、助手、家居，然后车载、机器人，这样一些这样的一些场景上面我们都有一些相关的积累。
"Now, let's see …I'll present two examples of what else the platform can do.",然后接下来大家可以去，额我可以给大家简单看这么两个例子，看一下我们到底还能解决一些什么其他的问题。
Please play the video.,额，麻烦播一下视频。

"So I keep telling my friends that if they want to show their loyalty to love, self-destruction is not an option.",所以我也不停地跟我的朋友说，如果你想表示你对爱情的忠贞，靠毁灭自己是成全不了你的爱情的。
"Well, let's get back to my topic and explain why would I talk about slow life today.",那好我们再把这些话题回过来，为什么我要今天讲慢生活。
"Because many people on Weibo have asked me how came I, a PhD graduate, was still a physician after working for 11 years, and whether I felt ashamed of it?",因为微博上很多人都问我你一个博士毕业生工作到现在十一年了怎么还是主治丢不丢人？
I tell everyone I never feel ashamed.,我告诉大家不丢人。
Why not?,为什么呀？

"After I came to, thank you, to this understanding, our director got worried.",我想明白，谢谢大家，我想明白这些以后呢，我们主任犯愁了。
Why?,为什么？
"For being the only senior female PhD in the emergency department and eloquent at the same time, I did not participate in the application of research projects or apply for experimental funds with hospital leaders.",急诊科难得的一个这么老的一个女博士生，而且这么能说会道的，竟然不参与课题的申请了，不去医院里面跟院领导申请要实验经费了。
My leader was anxious and decided to send me to the United States to receive capitalist re-education.,领导急了，于是决定把我派到美国去，接受资本主义的再教育。

"In my eyes, she is becoming more and more gorgeous.",比如我觉得她一路都在越变越漂亮。
You may wonder why we're talking about her.,然后这个女孩为什么要提到她呢？

"Out of curiosity, I watched her controversial speech titled Desperate College Students.",然后我点开她那一篇挺有名的叫《绝望的大学生》这篇演讲稿一看。
"Half way through, I realized, ""oh! I am one of them!""",诶，我就看到一半儿我就恍然大悟了说，哦，原来我是一个绝望的大学生呀！
I am exactly one of those college students in her speech.,因为我就几乎是她所说的那种类型。
"Well, I have been a typical straight A student and well-educated, but I may make much less money than those WeChat retailers who like to brag about their leisurely and luxurious life, or those punsters who write jokes for a living.",比如我是一个呃有点儿典型的学霸，然后我就是她所说的那种读了很多很多年的书，但是可能还没有一个擅长吃喝玩乐上蹿下跳的微商小丽，或者段子手挣得多的人。
I think college students with a rural background like me are most vulnerable to desperation after reading this article.,而且我觉得看到这篇文章最容易绝望的应该就是我们这些农村出来的大学生。
"We are often confronted with people taunting us, ""You won't make much money after graduation, for diplomas now are less rare and valuable.",而且我们常常听到这种奚落，就是你大学毕业了，你根本挣不到什么钱，你的大学文凭现在已经就不值钱了。
"The diplomas of the post 80's generation, who are trying to make a living in the cities after graduation, no longer neccessarily guarantee you apartments, permanent urban residence certificates or jobs.""",八零后进城的这一代大学生，他们的毕业文凭已经不能够直接的等于房子、户口、工作了。
There used to be two classes of over 100 students when I was in the 6th grade.,然后在我呃小的时候读六年级的时候，我们班上有一百多个同学，两个班。
"But when I graduated from college, no more than 5 of us have college diplomas.",然后等到我大学毕业的时候，我回头一看，就是我们所有的同学到最后读大学的就不超过五个人。
Where did the rest of them go?,那剩下的人都去哪儿了呢？
They went directly to work.,然后他们就去打工了。
Some of them came from a modest family.,然后这些家庭其实相对来说是经济条件还可以的。
"Families that financially struggled most was those that have to pay for the education of their children, just like mine.",然后最贫穷的就是我们这些家里面有孩子在读大学的家庭。
"Being students means that we have little means of relieving their financial burden, yet the parents had to pay for our tuition every semester in college.",呃因为我们没有办法给父母补贴一分钱，而且我们还让父母一直在不断地周期性地来支付学费。
"To these families, their children's education came at a high price.",这对他们来说非常的昂贵。
That makes them more expectant of their children's earning potential. They expect these graduates to give back to the families immediately after graduation so that they could become rich overnight.,所以他们就更加地期待就是这个孩子他只要一毕业就可以立刻地回报家庭，让他们一朝致富。
"The pressure that I have mentioned, such as buying a hourse and the rising house price, shrinked employment caused by the expansion of college enrollment, as well as the jealousy against those rich WeChat retailers, like Xiaoli.",但是我说的种种的压力，比如买房，房价上涨；就业很困难，因为扩招；然后再加上隔壁然后微商小丽给的刺激。
"These are very likely to stifle our hopes in ourselves, our education system, and the society.",就这些像我这样的大学生毕业之后就很容易对自己失望，对教育失望，对社会也失望。
"However, I think this predicament is not caused by these factors, but our misunderstanding of college education.",我觉得这并不是他们的错，是我们对大学的定位定错了。
College itself is never supposed to be a cradle of future millionaires.,其实大学它本来就不应该是一个培养百万富翁的地方。
"It should stay true to its original function, which is to be a place for us to continuously acquire knowledge.",就它应该回归到它自己的本意去，就成为一个深度追求知识的地方。
And college enrollment should be trimmed so that vocational and technical schools could flourish.,然后让大学缩招，让一些技术类的学校啊、实践类的学校去成长、去发展。
"In this way, parents won't hold their hopes too high for their children who are admitted into decent colleges.",然后这样当一个孩子他去考了一个还不错的大学的时候。
"They won't think of college education as a fast lane to the pinnacle of life, or sudden wealth.",他的家长不会一下子就把他定义为天之骄子，也不会说哦我的孩子从此就走上了人生巅峰，去期待他一毕业就发财。
"Ma Jiajia mentioned in her speech that we, the desperate college students, would never become rich with outdated knowledge and hidebound jobs for the rest of our lives.",马佳佳她在她的演讲里面也提到了，对于呃就是我们这些完蛋的的大学生，哼，学了一堆过时的、没用的知识，找一份儿工作拿工资，一辈子都发不了财。
Her speech The Desperate College Students aimed to talk to the young people who yearn for climbing up the social ladder and achieving financial independence.,然后她的演讲的题目叫做《绝望的大学生》，呃给那些渴望在身强力壮的年纪完成阶层流动和获得财务自由的年轻人。
I think I'm one of them too.,诶我觉得我就是，我非常渴望。
"However, rather than agreeing with what she said, I have a different message for the young people.",但是我想我对我自己说的并不是她说的那番话，我想对我自己说的是这些。
"First, do not blindly focus on achieving the financial independence and the your social class transition while at a young age.",第一，就是不要过度地渴望在你还年轻的时候就直接完成阶层的流动，然后就获得财务自由。
What are the consequences of expecting such things when you are still young?,然后这样的过度地期待年少成名跟年少致富的结果是什么？
"Everyone would expect great fortunes to suddenly fall into their laps, when this era doesn’t need that many millionares.",是每个一人都想成为时代的风吹起的猪，但是时代的风吹不起那么多的猪。
"Every now and then I see people my age gathering together, despite the difference in their education background, and discussing about starting up Internet-based businesses.",我经常看到我的同龄人们，然后他们现在三五个不管是什么专业的人兴奋地扎成一堆儿，然后在一块儿讨论一个互联网的一个创业的点子。
"Regardless of whether they are capable of doing it or whether their specialities can back their ambitions up, they all consider receiving investments as the sole standard of success.",然后他们都不不晓得不管那自己是不是擅长，然后也不管自己是不是这个专业，然后所有的目的就是圈一笔钱走人。
The critera of judging a successful new business for them is whether they can get money from investors.,然后以拿没拿到投资人的钱作为一个创业是否成功的标准。
"I don't believe this is a positive example for college students, because no college students in any country can make a fortune right after graduation.",我觉得这不是一个健康的成长模式，没有哪个国家的大学生他一毕业就立刻成功发财的。
I think It’s okay to live a frugal life at a young age.,其实在年少的时候，没有钱是一件很正常的事情在我看来。
Having an advanced education background does not necessarily guarantee anything.,因为我们这是天之骄子给了你错觉。
"No matter which country you are from, you have to learn to be a social man after graduating and starting to work.",任何国家都是你从一个学校，然后进入社会都是从一个平凡的一个社会人做起的。
"One of my professors once said that anyone who isn't intellectually challenged can succeed in their line of business, or even rise to the top of the industry, as long as they work hard there for ten or twenty years.",像我们的大学教授他有一句话是这么说，只要你不是特别笨，你在一个行业做上二十年，就很容易在这个行业做得还不错，甚至成为这个行业的翘楚。
Why did he say that?,为什么呢？
No one can stay stick to it for 20 years.,因为没有人可以坚持二十年。
"In spite of the survivorship bias, what he said was intended to tell us was that each profession has a unique development cycle, which may not apply to other sectors, but you have to wait patiently, and accumulate as much knowledge and experience as you can.",可能他这番话也有幸存者的偏差，但是它可以告诉我们职业的发展有它自己的周期，可能不适用所有的职业，但是你要耐心地等待，你要慢慢地积累跟沉淀。
This is the first message I want to give to myself and my peers.,这是我想我对自己说的和像我这样的年轻人说的第一句话。
"Second, we should slow down our pace to find out what we are really interested in.",然后第二个，就是我们应该慢慢地去探索我们应该做什么这件事情。
It should be a process of us perfecting our inner selves and then improving the outside world.,我们应该慢慢地去探索，应该是一个由内而外的过程。
Richness should no longer be regareded as the most dominant or the only standard.,而不是以前作为最重要的和唯一的标准。
"In my opinion, an ideal system is supposed to be like this.",我觉得一个正常的教育的秩序应该是这样的。
"When you are a kid, your partents and teachers will help you discover and explore your interests, so that you know if you are into math or sports, or if you are good at writing or physics.",当你是一个小孩儿的时候你到学校去，然后老师家长他们协助你去发现你自己，协助你去探索你自己，让你知道我是喜欢数学还是喜欢体育，让我知道我是擅长写作还是擅长物理。
"Then when your are going to college, you will have a clear idea of  what you are interested in and what you like to choose your field.",然后当你要去读一个大学的时候，你几乎可以去判定我的兴趣在哪儿，我喜欢学什么，然后你去学它。
The current education system and the upbringing of our generation have almost taken away our right to do so.,当然我们的教育模式呃加上像我这样的小孩的成长背景就几乎剥夺了我们去发掘自己兴趣的权利。
We are deprived of the right since we go to school.,我们一进入学校的时候。
"The standard that measures our performance as students has always been our scores in examinations, the same standard applies in primary schools, then in senior high school entrance examination and college entrance examination.",从小学开始，然后中考、高考所有的标准就是成绩，每一个小孩儿都都被剥夺了这种权利。
Choosing to major in science or liberal arts may be your only right.,你唯一的权利可能就是你去选你是学文科还是理科。
"If you are not strong-minded enough, that right may be taken away by our parents.",然后如果你还不够强的话，这权力还是会被你爸妈剥夺。
"When you graduate from college and finanlly have the right to choose an occupation, I think it would be a pity to let money be the only critera of your career choice.If you just want a job that pays well and then miss the chance of exploring your true passion and talent,you may never have the chance to know what you really like to do.","当我们毕业的时候，终于可以去选择一份职业的时候，我认为如果你再因为钱。哪个钱多去哪儿，哪个好挣钱我就去哪儿，然后去忽略自己的兴趣，忽略自己的特长，这是一件特别特别可惜的事儿,你永远都不知道自己擅长什么了。"
The preface of a book written by Wang Xiaobo appeals to me.,然后我以前特别喜欢王小波的一本书的序。
In the preface he explains why he loves writing.,他在那本序里面写说我为什么喜欢写作。
He says that in America business is business.,他说美国人然后美国人就是Americans business is business。
And the Americans are all about business.,就是美国人永远都是经商热。
"But he chose to write books for a living, which, in their eyes, is arduous but fruitless, equivalent to the physics process of anti-entropy.",他选择就是写作呃就是在大家看来是一个吃力不讨好的。
"In other words, he chose to ""seek loss and avoid profits"".",呃一个趋害避利的一个反熵过程。
I don't really understand why he describes the development of human civilization as the process of anti-entropy.,当然他他说人类的文明的发展本来就是一个反熵过程，这句话我不是特别理解。
But I can't agree more with his argument that he chose writing because he believed he had a gift in writing and becoming a writer was his destiny.,但是他后面一句话，他说如果你非要问我说我为什么选择写作的话，我就告诉你一句话，我认为我有写作的天分，我应该去做这件事儿。
"In my eyes, this is a very brilliant standard for choosing a profession, you should choose your occupation based on your interests and your talent, you should think of your personal situation, instead of following the social trend or the money.",这是我觉得一个特别特别好的一个去选择职业的一个标准，就是你做这件事情它应该取决于你的兴趣和你是否擅长，应该从内向外看，而不是说时代的风吹到哪儿你就去做什么，什么钱多你就去哪儿。
"You should dedicate yourself to the profession that your're interested in, give everything you can and seek self-fulfillment your whole life.",你应该在你自己擅长的感兴趣的职业里面，然后终其一生去发挥自己的能力，去无限地无限地延伸自己这自己这个人，实现自己。
This is a choice that no one can blame or disrespect you for.,这是我认为一个没有人可以否定你跟不尊重你的一个选择模式。
The last message that I have for myself and you is that do not look down on knowledge only because you are in a shitty college.,我想对我自己说的第三句话，就是不要因为上了一个破大学就看不起知识。
I only read half of Ma Jiajia's speech.,因为马佳佳那篇文章我没有看完，我只看了前半段。
"In my opinion, it more or less indicates that knowledge will only be useful when it brings you fortune and well-paid jobs.",我觉得里面呃多多少少有一种，只要这个知识它不能给我们带来财富，不能给我们带来房子带来工作，它就是无用的。
This conclusion sounds arbitrary to me.,这样未免太武断了。
I don't know if knowledge could still change fates or if knowledge could still bring you fortune.,我觉得知识到底还能不能改变命运，知识它到底能不能换做金钱。
"I assume the answer is negative, at least for the time being.",可能暂时不能。
For knowledge is far less important in front of money.,因为知识在金钱面前极有可能一文不名。
"But that does not matter, because the value of knowledge cannot be measured with your income.",但是这并不重要，因为知识的衡量单位不是文。
"I used to loathe reading books in the past, for I thought it went against my lifelong goal, which was to fulfill my personal well-being.",然后我觉得我以前对于读书这件事情特别有偏见，我以前的人生观就是我实现个人的最大幸福就是我这辈子的最大追求。
"TI thought that being forced to read books would not add to my happiness, so I chose not to read much.",所以我不认为就是老强迫自己去读书可以增加自己的幸福感，所以我不读。

Next we will have my collegue Zhao Chengduo to give us an introduction.,下面我们就会请我的同事赵成舵来给大家额介绍一下。
"It's your time, Chengduo.",额下面时间交给成舵。
Welcome Chengduo!,欢迎成舵！
"When you disagree or have a conflict with your family, what is your solution to the problem?",当你和你的家人出现分歧或者矛盾的时候，你有没有想过通过什么样的方式来解决这个矛盾?
Who of you can provide an answer?,谁能回答我？
"Ever since the very beginnings of mankind, we have had three ways to settle conflicts.",从人类诞生之日起，人类解决问题的方式有三种。
"The first is violence, like quarrels, fights or even war between countries; and the second is by rules.",第一种就是暴力，吵架或者打架、国家之间的战争，第二种叫做规则。
What if the existing rules are not applicable and new ones are not put forward?,那么当规则被打破，而新的规则又没有构建起来的时候，怎么办？
We negotiate.,两个字：谈判。
"Therefore, negotiation is not an optional skill but rather an indispensable life skill, and it is one of the fundamental solutions for problems.",所以谈判是人们解决问题的基本方式之一，它不是一个可有可无的技能，而是我们的基本生存之道 。
"I have a friend, who lives happily with his family in Shanghai.",我有一位朋友，在上海有一个幸福的家庭。
"We once recollected memories of the past just beside the rough Huangpu River, and we referred to these memories as the 'tale of two cities'.",有一次我和他们在滚滚的黄浦江边，畅谈起了多年之前的一个往事，叫双城故事。
"This was a film, wasn't it?",这是一部电影的名字，对吗？
Indeed they did live a life similar to that in the film.,可是他们家真实地上演了双城故事。
"He stayed in Shanghai while his wife stayed in Beijing, and we know that if couples are separated for long, problems will inevitably occur.",女士在北京，男士在上海，那么我们发现两地分居时间一长，矛盾自然积累。
"Although they loved each other, the two could not bear the separation, especially since they had a baby to feed, not to mention other pressures and an unfavorable transportation situation.",虽然彼此都很爱对方，那个时候孩子还小，但是现实的压力，又没有现在交通那么方便，让他们不堪其苦。
"First they resorted to violence and quarrels, after which they did not talk with one another.",于是开始暴力，开始吵架，最后到双方不说话开始冷战。
"Finally, his wife filed a divorce suit to the court hoping that the rules could come to her rescue.",那么当然女士受不了，于是只好诉诸规则，到法院提出离婚诉讼。
"He really wanted to save their marriage, but there was nothing that he could do, because his wife had made up her mind, and she refused to live such a life any longer.",男士非常想挽救这段婚姻，可是苦于没有办法，因为女方去意已决，无法忍受这样的一种生活。
What now could be done?,怎么办？
He approached a negotiations expert.,他找到了谈判专家。
"At that time, I told him whenever you want to negotiate, set your goal first.",当时，我告诉他，谈判，任何时候确认自己的目标。
Do you still love her?,你还爱她吗？
Of course.,爱。
Then do you want to win her back?,你还想挽回吗？
"Certainly, yes.",想挽回。
Are you willing to compromise within reason?,你愿意为此妥协和适当让步吗？
Yes.,愿意。
"Here we may have readers who are law practitioners, and as we know, judges do not announce the adjudication at the very beginning of a hearing.",好，那么大家知道，法院开庭之后，我们可能有法律界的朋友，法官一般不会先判。
"Since they chose to settle their problems by rules, a negotiation was first required.",虽然你诉诸规则，可是规则上告诉你首先要协商。
So the couple had to negotiate after the court was adjourned.,于是呢，庭后双方协商。
"At this stage both parties could offer terms, and he was very determined to raise their child and renounce his property.",这个时候双方提条件，男方的条件非常明确，孩子给我，财产归你。
What was the reason behind this?,有原因，为什么？
What he said may surprise you a lot.,接下来他讲的话出乎很多人的意料。
"""I will give you all of our belongings because I love you. You can live a decent life without worrying about the child. Generally, women can live longer than men, so if you are still alone when our child reaches adulthood and I die before you, then he can take care of you.""",因为财产归你，我爱你，你可以拿着财产没有孩子的拖累，孩子我把他一直养大，有可能男的比女的早衰先死，有一天，我把他养大，我先死之后，如果你还是孤家寡人，他继续可以为你养老送终。
He didn't divide their property fifty-fifty or thirty-seventy as is typically the case.,他没有像一般的人一样去分财产，五五或者三七。
"Were he to do so, it would not be a negotiation but rather a dispute.",这不叫“谈判”，这叫“争端”。
"Love for her was his biggest bargaining chip, and not only was his wife stunned, but the female judge was very surprised.",他用了最大的一个谈判筹码，就是他对他妻子的爱，这个时候不但他的妻子愣住了，连那个主审的女法官也愣住了。
"So the judge led his wife to another intermediation room, and said, ""In all the years of my career, I have rarely met such a man. I can see your marriage has a solid foundation, and separation and disagreement should never be the excuse to tear apart a family.""",于是女法官把他的妻子拖到旁边另外一间调解室，告诉他的妻子：“我做法官离婚案那么多年，我很少见到这样的男士，你们的婚姻是有基础，现实的分离和观点的分歧，不应该成为一个家庭破裂的一个前提。”
"Right at this moment, he entered the room and emphasized one more thing to his wife, ""Let's not argue over right or wrong, Beijing or Shanghai; let's let our child decide where we should live. Wherever he goes to school in the future, or wherever is favorable to his growth, is the place we reunite.""",那么这个时候，这位男士走进了调解室，告诉他的爱人，又追加了一句：“我们不要再非此即彼，非黑即白，不是北京就是上海，我们让孩子决定一切，未来孩子在哪里上学，哪里对他发展最有利，我们一家人一定在哪里团聚。”
"Her eyes filling with tears, his wife still felt love at the bottom of her heart.",这个时候，这位女士的眼中闪动着泪花，因为她心中还有爱。
"Love was his leverage in the negotiation, and that evoked her love of their child.",男士用了最大的谈判筹码就是“爱”， 激发了这位女士对她孩子的爱。
"Their marriage was saved by negotiation before it broke down, and they restored a happy family.",今天他们一家三口幸福地生活在上海，而这场婚姻危机也以一场谈判的完胜而告终。
From their story you may realize that negotiation can save a family or even a country from collapsing.,所以我们发现谈判可能会去挽救一个家庭，甚至去挽救一个国家。
Negotiation is not about deceit or conspiracy; it is about reciprocal compromise and win-win solutions.,谈判不是尔虞我诈的见招拆招的一些阴谋，而是双方妥协协商的双赢之道。
"Again, negotiation is not dispensable, it is not a skill or technique that only salesman or businessman can grasp; rather it is an integral part of everyone's lives.",谈判不是可有可无的一种技能，或者一个是推销员、一个商业人员才可以去跟大家去学习的一种技能，或者一种技巧，它是我们本身人生在世的一种生存之道。
"If not a conspiracy, as you may assume, then what is negotiation?",谈判并不是大家想象的阴谋频出，而是什么？
It is a win-win solution.,双赢解决。
"You may find that speaking of negotiation, people either say they would never think of such a solution, or if they did, they wouldn't know what to do.",所以我们发现很多人一提起谈判，总觉得要么就没有想到用这样的解决方式去解决问题，要么就是想到了可是我不知道我自己该怎么做。
"Furthermore, they are reluctant to negotiate even if they know how, because they have the mindset that bargaining hurts feelings.",可能不一定做得到，即便做得到的时候，可能不愿意去做，认为讨价还价多伤感情啊。
"In fact, negotiation is not at all a simple bargain, it is obviously a mind game.",其实谈判哪里是单纯的讨价还价，分明就是大家的思维博弈。
Again what is negotiation?,谈判是什么？
Negotiation is the act of influencing people's decisions by talking with them.,是通过谈话影响大家的判断决策。
You may also think that only resourceful people can be negotiation experts.,我们发现很多人认为精明的人才是谈判专家。
"This is not true, however, as negotiation is everywhere in work and in life.",其实生活工作当中处处都有谈判。
Here is an example.,举个简单例子。
"My friend once had an interview, and his interviewer said, ""I've noticed that you are ranked 15th in your class, but not number one. We only recruit from the top 10.""",我的一位朋友参加一次面试，结果在面试的过程当中呢，别人说：“你为什么是班上的第十五名而不是第一名？我们这个公司只招top ten的前十名的所有人。”
Can you guess what my friend said?,你猜这位朋友怎么回答？
"Knowing how to negotiate, he answered, ""Yes, indeed, I was ranked 15th in my class, but I am number one to you.""",他会谈判，他说：“您搞清楚，我对我们班是第十五名，我对您就是第一名。”
"Quite surprised, the interviewer asked why.",哎！面试官被问愣了，“为什么。”
"""Though 15th, the top 5 students have gone abroad, the 6th to 10th were recommended as postgraduates, and the other 4 have already got job offers, so am I number one now?""",“因为我在我们班虽然是第十五名，但是前五名出国了，后五名保研了，第一十一名到第十四名已经找到工作拿到offer，我对您请教是不是第一名？”
My friend was hired immediately because he persuaded the interviewer successfully.,面试官马上盖章，因为他在短期内马上翻盘成功。
And now he works for a famous company as a sales director in east China.,现在这位朋友任某知名品牌华东区销售总监。
This was all because he knows how to negotiate.,因为他会谈判。
That's negotiation for a job.,那么这是对一个企业。
What about negotiation for a country?,但是我们发现对一个国家呢？
We have failed to reach an agreement with foreign countries over iron ore.,我们国家对外的铁矿石谈判，发现到现在为止依然没有谈成功。
Why is that?,为什么？
"It is neither that our country does not try hard, nor that our workers are not working together. Likewise there are not any spies.",不是国家不努力，也不是平时我们所想象的大家不团结或者出了内奸，完全不是。
"The iron ore producers talked to Japan and Korea in the first place, 'you have to accept my price, because there are no iron ore resources in your country.'",铁矿石方首先找日本、韩国谈，你必须要接受我的高价，因为你国内没有铁矿石资源。
"In principle Japan, South Korea can cut the price together with China, considering that we all believe that large procurement volumes are worth a discount.",日本、韩国完全可以跟中国联合起来一起去压价，我们的思维都认为量大从优，你必须给我优惠。
Then why do we have to bear high prices since China is the largest importer of iron ore?,中国量最大，为什么承受的价格还最高呢？
What we have not realized is that 30 years ago Japan purchased a stake in the iron ore producers.,可是我们不知道，早在三十年前，日本已经购买了铁矿石合作方的这样的一个股份。
"Therefore, although the prices of iron ore are raised and they have to pay more, as the iron ore prices go up globally, due to the WTO rule of automatic application, which states that all the commercial terms and conditions accepted by Japan and South Korea will be automatically applicable to third parties including China, they make China pay more by accepting the raised price.",因此，虽然人家A口袋把铁矿石价格拉高，这样的话呢的确采购成本要多付出很多，可是全球铁矿石价格推高，因为俱乐部WTO当中有一个自动适用原则，日本、韩国接受的贸易条款，自动适用第三国包括中国，所以人家首先接受把铁矿石价格推高，等中国出来买的时候，我们又更多的付出出去。
"Since they are shareholders of the iron ore mines, they make greater profits.",那么他另外一个口袋，因为我在那有股份，所以我还能更多的赚回来。
"Obviously, they share the same interests as the mine owners.",人家分明就是一家人。
"In my opinion, skilled players think broadly while less skilled players think concretely.",所以我说低手设计，高手做局。
"It is neither because we have not attended negotiation lessons, nor because we do not execute well what we have learned.",中国在谈判桌上不是我们不努力，不是我们没有听谈判课。
"The reason is because the terms and conditions are pre-determined, and we have no pricing rights, which are also part of national sovereignty.",而是我们发现别人把格局早已设定好，所以我们丢失了定价权，因为定价权也是国家主权。
"During the European sovereign debt crisis, China negotiated with Europe to recognize China's market economy status because the WTO regarded China as an incomplete market economy.",欧债危机的时候中国跑到欧洲去谈判，提出一个筹码叫还我中国市场经济及地位，因为WTO把中国看做负不完全市场经济国家。
Maybe you do not know how significant such a title is to China.,大家可能不知道这个称号为什么对我们很重要。
"Whatever we purchase is abnormally expensive, like iron ore; and whatever we sell is quite the opposite, yet other countries may still prosecute us for anti-dumping.",中国买铁矿石，买什么什么贵，可是我们卖东西出去的时候，卖什么什么便宜，还被别人告反倾销。
Why do we always lose these anti-dumping suits?,那么为什么反倾销官司我们打不赢？
"We lose because other countries do not treat China as a market economy, so they think that our selling prices are lower than our costs.",因为你不是市场经济国家，所以你的倾销叫做成本高于售价。
Chinese manufacturers feel frustrated because research can prove that the costs are indeed lower than the selling prices.,可是我们中国企业很委屈，那我的成本你可以来查，确实低于售价。
"But they do not recognize our labor as a production factor, because they consider China as an incomplete market economy.",对不起，因为你是不完全市场经济国家，你的劳动力不能作为要素而存在。
Labor from a complete market economy should be chosen for comparison.,必须选择完全市场经济国家的劳动力。
Then what countries are chosen?,选谁呢？
Canada and Russia.,加拿大、俄罗斯。
"In Canada, a worker can earn CAD 100,000 yearly, an unimaginable figure for Chinese enterprises, so in this case, we are definitely dumping.",好，加拿大一个工人年薪10万加币，中国企业怎么算都算不出过来这个账，于是一算你一定倾销。
"As a result, they resist our cheap products so as to protect their own jobs.",所以的话呢，你卖便宜货都把你打回去，保护我自己的工作机会。
"So when China proposed to Europe that we could help them to tackle their debt crisis, in return, they could recognize our market economy status.",结果当中国向欧洲提出，我可以救援你欧债危机，但是你要给我市场经济地位。
What was Europe's reaction?,欧洲的态度是什么？
"They said, ""Well, we can talk about your help later. At present, we are trying to rescue ourselves from this crisis via internal negotiation. As for market economy status, let us see what the results of our negotiations are.""",欧洲说呃救援的问题我们可以之后再谈，我们启动欧债危机谈判自救，市场经济地位嘛，我们后边也再谈谈看。
"What they imply is that they would rather be bankrupt than recognize our status; and behind this, pricing rights matter a lot.",他们的潜台词是，我宁可自己政府破产，我也不给你市场经济地位，因为背后是谈判桌上的定价权。
"So their unspoken words are, ""Even if we struggle in poverty, you can never have pricing rights.""",因此他们的潜台词是“我穷死，我也不给你定价权”。
"What we care about are prices, while what they cherish are pricing rights.",我们要的是钱，而别人要的是定价权。
"Such facts make it inevitable that whatever we buy is expensive, and whatever we sell is cheap.",所以我们买什么什么贵，卖什么什么便宜。
"I want to tell you all that pricing rights are also matters of national sovereignty, and we should negotiate for them.",因此我告诉大家，谈判的定价权也是国家主权之一，我们应该为了国家的主权而谈判。
"You may notice that negotiation can be found throughout many occasions, like negotiations during family disagreements, business cooperation, labor relations in the NBA, hostage rescue, China-America negotiations, European sovereign debt negotiations, etc.",我们发现，谢谢，在日常的生活工作当中，家庭矛盾需要谈判，企业合作需要谈判，NBA打球出现劳资危机需要谈判，人质解救需要谈判，中国和美国需要谈判，欧债危机需要谈判。
"The world is a giant negotiation arena, and negotiation is a part of our daily lives.",世界是一张巨大的谈判桌，而谈判是我们最基本的一种生存方式。
"Negotiation is not an unnecessary skill, nor is it deceit or conspiracy; it is an opportunity for us to sit down and talk with win-win attitudes about win-win solutions.",我们发现谈判并不是可有可无的一种技谋，更不是尔虞我诈的阴谋，谈判是我们每个人都可以坐下来，请坐好商量的双赢思维和双赢决策。
"My question for you all, then, is how do we negotiate?",所以我们发现告请教大家一句话，我们的谈判应该如何进行？
We influence people's decisions by talking with them.,通过谈话，影响对方判断决策。
"Communication is irreplaceable, and negotiation is indispensable.",所以人人需要沟通，万事皆可谈判。
Thanks!,谢谢！
Can I ask you a question?,如果我问个问题?
Is there anything in common between the two girls who look dramatically different from each other?,这两个相貌差别如此巨大的女孩子，她们之间有什么相同的地方吗？
Please think about it.,大家想一想。
Any idea?,我不知道你们猜到了吗？
"Let me tell you, what they have most in common is that both of them wish to improve their looks through plastic surgery.",我来告诉你，她们之间最大的共同之处就是她们都想通过整形改善自己的容貌。
It's easy to understand the beauty needs of the second girl.,对于后面这位患者来讲她的美容需求我想大家不难理解。
This girl is one of my patients.,她是我亲自接诊的一个患者。
"She is 16 years old, a native of Changxing County, Zhejiang Province.",今年十六岁，是浙江长兴人。
Her family runs a small hand weaving workshop.,她的家里呢开了一个手工的织布的小作坊。
"One day when she was 12, after washing her hair, she played on the open ground next to a loom.",在她十二岁的那一年，有一天她洗完头以后，披散着头发在织布机旁边的这个空地上玩耍。
Suddenly she felt a stomachache and crouched down to press her belly.,突然她感到一阵肚子疼，她蹲下身去按住肚子。

"Hearing her screaming, her mother ran out and turned off the loom, but it was too late.",听到惨叫声，她的妈妈跑出来，把机器关掉已经为时已晚。
The loom had pulled off her entire scalp and the upper and lower eyelids on the left side of her face.,她整个的头皮连同左侧的上下眼睑已经完全的被织布机从头颅上撕了下来。
I still clearly remember when she was send to the emergency room of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital four years ago.,我至今仍然清晰地记得四年前，她来我们九院急诊室时的情景。
"Her left eyeball and the whole skull were skinless and bloody, so appalling that one could hardly bear the sight of it.",她整个的左边的眼球包括整个的头颅，全部裸露着，血肉模糊惨不忍睹。
"We gave her emergency treatment and multiple touch-up surgeries, but as you can see from this photo I took two days ago, we still fail to give her a head of hair and restore her eyelids.",我们为她进行了紧急的救治以及后续的多次的手术治疗，可是直到今天大家看到这张照片是我前两天我为她拍的，我们依然没有办法还给她一头秀发和美丽的眼睑。
"For this girl, cosmetic surgery is a real boon and a must.",对于这个女孩子来说，美容手术是雪中送炭，是必不可少。
It is the greatest wish of her and her family to restore her appearance to its pre-injury state.,对于她来说能够恢复到受伤前的容貌就已经是她和她家人最大的心愿。
"Then, let's take a look at the first girl.",我们再来看前面这位女孩子。
You may think plastic surgery is unnecessary for her because she is quite pretty.,大家一定会觉得她已经很美啦，不需要整啦。
"But I'm telling you, not only did she have plastic surgery, it also cost her life.",可是我告诉你，她不仅整了，而且还为此送上了性命。
Her name is Wang Bei.,她叫王贝。
Some of you who are familiar with the TV program Super Girl or plastic surgery may know her story.,熟悉超女或者是整形的朋友可能知道她的故事。
"Two years ago, when she was going through a mandibular angle splitting osteotomy at a plastic surgery hospital in Wuhan, she died of airway obstruction of respiratory tract at the age of 24.",她两年前在武汉的一家整形机构做下颌角截骨手术的时候，因为术后发生了呼吸道的梗阻，抢救无效死亡，花样年华止步于二十四岁。
"This is an extreme case, of course.",虽然这是一例非常极端的意外事故。
"But for beauty seekers like Wang Bei, cosmetic surgery, something that should have made them more beautiful, unexpectedly took their lives.",但是对于像王贝这样的求美者来说，美容本来应该是锦上添花的好事，却为此送上了性命。
Was it worth it?,值得吗？
"Here, by telling the stories of these two girls, I want to share some of my thoughts from them.",我在这里给大家讲这两位女孩的故事，就是想说她们引起我很多的思考。
"For starters, should we pursue beauty throughout our lifetime?",首先，我们对美貌的追求应该是无止境的吗？
"Given the risks and costs, how far should we go in our pursuit of beauty?",我们为了追求美貌所要付出的风险和代价，应该把握怎么样的一个度呢？
"What should we do to ensure that the cosmetic surgery is an icing on the cake, that it brings positive and meaningful changes to our looks and lives?",我们又应该怎么样做才能真正的使美容成为锦上添花，为我们的容貌和我们的生活带来好的积极有意义的改变呢？
And one more question. A fundamental one.,还有一个更根本的问题。
What is beauty?,到底什么是美呢？
"First, I believe that health is the premise of beauty.",首先，我认为健康才是美的前提。
You can see there is a pair of breasts.,大家看这样的一对乳房。
"They are plump, perky and beautiful!",丰满、挺拔、优美！
"But if I tell you that there are lots of time bombs and dangerous goods buried in this pair of breasts, do you still think they are beautiful?",可是如果我告诉你，这对乳房里面埋着很多定时炸弹，埋着很多危险品，你还会觉得她美吗？
"Yes, there is Amazingel in them.",是的，这对乳房里面就是埋着奥美定。
This girl is a victim of a breast augmentation by injected Amazingel.,这位女孩子是奥美定隆胸的受害者。
She received the breast augmentation surgery in a beauty institution without being well informed about Amazingel.,她在不明就里的情况下很草率地就在一家美容机构接受了奥美定的注射隆胸。
"Having known the toxic side effects of Amazingel later, she turned to us to take it out from her breasts.",后来知道奥美定的毒副作用以后不得不来找我们，再把这个奥美定取出来。
What's in the bowl is the Amazingel we took out from her on our operating table.,旁边的这个碗里边的这个东西就是我们手术台上取出来的这个奥美定。
"But unfortunately, the modern technologies and methods can never remove Amazingel completely, and the residual gel in her body is like a ticking bomb that we don’t know when or how it will explode.",但是很遗憾，依据我们现在的这个技术和手段，注射进去的奥美定我们并不能百分之百的完全取出来，那么残留在她身体里的这些奥美定就像炸弹，不知道什么时候以何种方式引爆。
"So here, as cosmetic injection is growing in popularity, I want to say something to those who wish they were more beautiful.",所以在这里我也想给大家各位爱美的人士一个忠告，我们现在注射美容很流行。
Please remember two things.,但是请大家记住两点。
"Firstly, please choose regular medical institutions whenever you seek cosmetic treatment.",第一，如果你要去接受美容的治疗，请一定到正规的医疗机构。
And be careful with any barbershop or irregular individual workshop that tells you that they can offer beauty services.,不要说外面什么理发店里或者什么地方跟你说啊我可以给你美一下，你就觉得就去了。
It's much easier to inject something into our body than taking it out.,那么你打进去的时候很容易，取出来很难。
"Secondly, please be sure to know what injections you are taking, and to keep their barcodes and product numbers.",第二一点，在接受注射治疗的时候请一定问清楚你注射进去的东西是什么，它的条形码、它产品的一些编号你一定要收着。
Only in this way can we protect ourselves and make ourselves healthy and beautiful.,只有这样才能保护我们才能真正的使我们是能够健康的美着。
"Then, I believe that the true beauty is not only about your apperance, but also your internal cultivation.",第二我认为，美需要内外兼修。
"Definitely, cosmetic surgery is a way to improve our looks in a very short period of time, but our inner world, thoughts and selves are hard to be upgraded by a plastic surgery overnight.",美容手术可以在短时间内改变我们的容貌，可是一个人的内在修养和气质内涵，却不是靠几个整形手术一朝一夕就可以铸就的。
"When doing clinic hours, I have met patients of all kinds, of which young girls contributed the largest proportion, including students, young white collars, country girls working in cities, and NEET group.",我在看专家门诊的时候会接触到形形色色的患者，年轻女孩子是她们当中最主要的一个群体，那她们当中有学生、有年轻白领、也有打工妹、啃老族。
I can almost tell what they do for a living at first glance from what they dress and how they talk.,从她们来就诊时候的这个衣着打扮和谈吐，我基本上能判断出她们的身份。
"Most of them did have a correct understanding of their beauty needs and their appearance, but some were not.",她们当中的大多数呢对自己的美容需求，对自己的容貌，都有一个正确的认识，但是也有一部分人是相当盲从的、迷糊的。
"I have a story for you, a few days ago, maybe two weeks from now, I had a patient who looked very young, probably under twenty.",我给大家讲一个小故事，就是前两天呃前两个星期吧，我接诊的一个患者，大概非常年轻，不到二十岁的样子。
"She came into my consulting room and said, “Doctor, I want to fix my nose.”",她跑到我的诊室对我说：“医生，我要整鼻子。”
"I looked at her nose and asked her, ""which part of your nose do you think that need to be fixed?”",我说我看了看她的鼻子，我问她，我说：“你觉得你的鼻子什么地方不美呢？”
"“I don’t know, all my girlfriends think my nose is ugly.”",“不知道，反正我的小姐妹都说我的鼻子不好看。”
"Then I asked her, ""What kind of nose do you want?""",那我接着又问她：“那你想整成一个什么样的鼻子呢？”
“I have no idea. Whatever looks better than it does now.”,“不知道，反正比现在好看就行。”
"From a professional perspective, I analyzed the imperfections of her nose and offered three solutions.",后来我只好从专业的角度帮她分析她的鼻子存在的不不足之处。
I told her to choose one from the three plans according to her expectation.,然后呢帮她指出你我有三套方案可以给你，那么，你在这三套方案可以达到什么样的一个效果，你可以从这当中选择。
"She was still puzzled but with determination and longing for this surgery, she finally made a choice with the help of her friends.",她依然无所适从，但是她很坚持我一定要做这个手术，最后还是在她的朋友的帮助下选择了其中的一套方案。
"Later, on the day of the surgery, she was lying on the operating table.",到了手术的那一天，她躺在手术台上。
I chatted with her and found out that she came to Shanghai just to have this plastic surgery.,我跟她闲聊，知道她是穿从外地专门来上海做整形手术的。
"Then I asked her, ""Did your parents know why you came to Shanghai?""",然后我就问她，我说：“你的父母知道你来手术吗？”
"She answered, “No, they didn’t.”",她说：“不知道。”
"I kept asking, ""Who gave you the money for the surgery?""",我又问她，我说：“那你做手术的钱是谁给你的呢？”
"""I borrowed it from my friends,"" she said.",她说：“我问朋友借的。”
"My heart sank when I heard that, to be frank, I wouldn't have agreed to operate on her if I had known that.",听到这个话我的心里咯噔一下，我真的觉得，如果我早知道是这样的情况就不要给她做手术。
"I really wanted to tell the girl that rather than borrowing money for plastic surgery, she might as well spend one percent of the surgery fee on a good book.",我真想对这个小姑娘说你与其借钱来整形，不如花上只要整形手术费1%的钱去买本好书来读吧。
"I truly believe that for a girl, the wisdom and beauty gained from learning trump what a beautiful nose brings to her.",我觉得对这个小姑娘来说，读书学习带给她的智慧和美丽远远要超过一个漂亮的鼻子给她的人生带来更多的帮助和裨益。
"A part from young womens, among my outpatients, middle-aged women account for a larger share.",相对于年轻女性来说，我的门诊患者里面还有更大一部分是中年女性患者。
They are richer than younger girls and are more willing to pay for youth and beauty.,相对于年轻的女孩子，她们更有经济实力，也更愿意为了挽回青春和美丽付出金钱的代价。
"Although most of them maintain a healthy attitude, there are also some who want to solve problems in their life through surgery.",她们当中的大多数也都有健康的心态，但是也有一部分人她们是因为生活当中遇到了这样那样的问题，想通过手术来改变。
"The most common example is that when there are marriage crisis and family issues, they expect to save their marriage and family by improving their looks through plastic surgery.",最常见的就是她们的婚姻和家庭出现了问题的时候，她期望通过整形手术改善她的容貌来挽回她的家庭和婚姻。
Here is an extreme case I had.,我遇到的最极端的一个例子。
"Five years ago, I received a half-aged couple in their fifties.",就是五年前，有一对中年夫妇，大概五十出头的样子吧，两个夫妇两个一起到我的诊室。
"Upon entering my office, the wife said, ""Doctor, I want a vaginoplasty.""",一进来妻子就对我说：“医生，我要做阴道紧缩术。”
"Before I could say anything, the husband said hastily, ""Doctor, don't listen to her!”",还没等我开口，丈夫就说：“医生，你不要给她做！”
"I looked at them, confused.",我很困惑地看着他们。
"Then the husband said to his wife, ""You don't have to do it. I cheated on you just for the sex. I will give you all the money and I also want to keep our family intact.""",就听到丈夫对妻子说：“你没必要做的呀，我在外面找个小三只是为了满足生理需求而已嘛，我钞票都给你的呀，家我也要的呀。”
"The wife exclaimed, “No! I don't want you to have the other woman.”",妻子说：“不行！不许你去找小三。”
I was totally shocked.,我当时都呆掉了。
I could not believe that this couple was actually fighting like this in front of me.,我觉得怎么会有这样的夫妻，怎么会在我面前会这样子毫无顾忌的吵架。
I didn't know how to help them.,然后我不知道怎么样去帮他们。
"Technically, I could do a surgery on that wife.",从专业的角度，我给妻子做个手术。
No problem at all.,这完全没有问题。
But I doubted that I could save her marriage with just one surgery？,但是我觉得，光靠我这一个手术就能挽救她的家庭吗？
Will this surgery stop the husband from cheating?,我妻子做完这个手术以后丈夫就可以回到她的身边不去找小三了吗？
"So, for middle-aged women with marital or family problems, it is far more important to figure out the reasons that cause such problems than worrying about their appearance.",所以我觉得对于中年女性来说，可能遇到的这样那样的婚姻或者家庭的问题，除了要从自己的美貌身上去找问题以外，可能还有更多的需要去思考和改进的地方。
My last message for you is that diversity is essential to beauty.,最后我想说：“个性才是美。”
"My patients often show me some celebrities’ photos and say, “Doctor, I want a nose like hers” and “Doctor, I want my chin to be like hers”.",我经常在门诊碰到这样的病人拿着某某明星的照片过来对我说，“医生，我要整成她那样的鼻子”“医生我要整成她那样的下巴”。
"They even say, “Doctor, I want a face like Fan Bingbing's”.",甚至有人会过来跟我说，“医生，我想整成范冰冰那样。”
"Whether they have the regular features to change into Fan Bingbing aside, our world will definitely be a dull and boring place if the streets are full of beauties who look like Fan Bingbing.",且不论这个患者她基础条件是不是能够整成范冰冰，但是我想，如果我们满大街都是范冰冰模式的美女，这个世界是不是太乏味和单调了呢。
"It is our different physical appearances that make our world colorful, interesting and  fascinating.",正因为我们每个人都有自己独特的容貌，我们这个世界才丰富多彩、异彩纷呈。
"If you are a plum, then don't dream of becoming a peach.",如果你生就是一个李子，那么就不要幻想有一天你能成为一个桃子。
"If you insist on changing yourself from a plum to a peach, you may become a bitter peach.",如果你执意要从一个李子变成一个桃子，等待你的可能就是变成一只烂桃子。
"So we should strive to be the most delicious and attractive plum, not a bitter peach, and plastic surgery can help us achieve that.",呵，所以我觉得我们应该努力使自己成为那只最好、最优美的李子，而不是成为一只烂桃子，而整形手术就是能帮助我们变成那只最好、最美的李子。
"I am willing to create more beautiful and attractive peaches and plums with my hands,  my scalpels, and my skills.",我愿意用我的双手、用我的手术刀、用我的技术为大家塑造出更多、更美、更好的桃子、李子。
And I hope that all of us can always pay equal attention to internal and external beauty when we're pursuing the true meaning of life.,我也希望我们每一个热爱生活的朋友在追求人生美好的过程当中都始终能够做到内外兼修。
"Each of us can be a plum, peach or orange with tempting appearance and unique taste.",让我们每一个人都做一只外表诱人、口感独特、耐人寻味的李子、桃子或者橙子。
Thank you all!,谢谢大家！
"Everyone, good evening.",大家晚上好。
Some people may wonder why a radio host like me would want to talk about drugs.,可能有人会觉得奇怪，你一个主持人今天来跟我们说什么毒品。
Why am I so interested in drugs?,你为什么会对毒品那么有兴趣？
"The reason why I want to talk about drugs dates back to over a decade ago, when I was the host of a radio show ""With You Till Dawn"".",这句话要说到十多年前，那时候我做的一套节目名字叫做《相伴到黎明》。
"On one late night, I received a call from a woman, whose son was 29 years old at that time.",在深夜的时候，我曾经接到过一位女士的电话，她的儿子那一年是29岁。

"In the end, he had no one else to turn to but his parents.",然后还赖着老两口要钱。

"On that very evening, the old couple had a discussion.",晚上的时候，老爷子就跟老太太商量。
"The woman's husband said:"" We raised our unfilial son, and he will be a danger to the society. I should kill him. In this case, I will die with him, but our society will be better off without him.""",说：“这个逆子是我们养的，终有一天他会祸害这个社会的，不如这样吧，还是我动手把他宰了，这样的话呢，两个人一起死，也算为社会做点儿贡献。”
"The woman had to choose between her husband, the man she went through thick and thin with, and her son, her own flesh and blood.",一个是自己相濡以沫很多年的老伴儿，一个是怀胎十月生下的孩子，再不好也是自己亲生的。
It was impossible for the old lady to pick a side.,所以老太太不知道该帮谁。
"She knew that if she had chosen her son, he would beat his father to death in less than 6 months.",她也知道如果自己这会儿偏袒了儿子，很有可能不出半年的时间，自己的丈夫就会死在儿子的拳下。
"Out of desperation, she thought of my show, picked up the phone and called me.",所以情急之间，觉得广播有用了，打了个电话给我。
"I was young at that time, and I considered everything either black or white.",我当时很年轻，然后觉得什么事儿都是直线思维。
I couldn't understand why people were like that.,我觉得怎么还会有这种人。
How could people be interested in heroin and opium?,怎么还会对海洛因啊、鸦片啊、白粉啊有兴趣？
How could they be so foolish?,怎么这么愚昧？
"I can still remember the cry of that old woman, and it has haunted me for many years.",当时最记忆深刻的是那个妈妈的哭声，那个哭声很多年都在我的耳边。
"Fast forward to the year 2007, the radio station needed to make new programs.",时间一晃到了2007年，当时的电台需要有新的节目策划。
"I was thinking about whether I should take risks, walk a fine line and create a show  that would benefit the society in some ways.",于是，我开始想，是不是要做这样的一个节目呢？冒风险，打擦边球，但是也许，对社会有意义。
"In the winter of 2007, we launched China's very first anti-drug radio show broadcasted on a regular schedule.",于是在那一年的冬天，就有了全中国的第一套常规的禁毒节目。
Please play the soundtrack.,有请我的音响师。
"When I produced my first show, some officials from the Shanghai Municipal Narcotics Control Commission told me that, ""Mengxiao, I think you can do the show for 6 months, but not a year.""",当我开始，把这个变成一套节目的时候，当时上海市禁毒办的领导告诉我说：“梦晓，你做半年我相信，你做一年我真的为你捏一把汗！”
"My show is still running, from the end of 2007 to now.",07年的年末到今天，这个节目一直生存着。
"However, as I came in contact with police officers, social workers, drug addicts and traffickers, I was surprised to learn that even narcotics have advanced with the times.",可是让我万万没有想到的是，在我开始更深地去了解所有和毒品打交道的人，缉毒干警、我们的社工、我们的瘾君子，还有贩毒人员的时候，我惊讶地发现，毒品也与时俱进了。
People who make and sell drugs have also adopted innovation in their trade.,贩毒者和造毒者居然也改革创新了。
"Opium and heroin, the substances that were once dangerous to people have been replaced by something far more deadly: new synthetic drugs.",那些我曾经以为的鸦片、白粉、海洛因，原来已经不再是特别危险的东西，更危险的东西有了一个新的名字叫做“新型合成毒品”。
"These new narcotics are known as ecstasy, happy water, ketamine, methamphetamine, magu, blue enchantress, forget-me-not and so on.",我来说它们的一些代名词：摇头丸、开心水、King粉、冰毒、麻古、蓝色妖姬、勿忘我等等等等。
What these drugs are for?,这些东西的作用是什么？
Do people not try meth out of curiosity?,今天是不是有人也曾经好奇地溜过冰？
"I don't want to do a raise-your-hand poll, because firstly, I cannot see you, and second, I have no doubt that there are people here who have tried it for the sake of curiosity.",我不敢让大家举手，而且我还看不见你，但是我相信今天在座的一定曾有人好奇过。
"Some people may call me out, claiming that I have exaggerated the danger of drugs just to scare others.",毒品这个东西有很多人说：你危言耸听了。
"They argued that drugs were like cigarettes, people were talking about the health hazard of tobacco, but still, there were many smokers out there.",那个东西就跟香烟一样，你们都说香烟，说了那么多年的不好，不是还有人抽吗。
"They may be right about smokers, but new synthetic drugs are nothing like cigarettes.",是，可是我说的新型合成毒品和香烟完全不一样。
"I don't know if you remember, during the end of the previous year and the beginning of last year, there was a case of a Porsche Cayenne hitting and killing 17 people in Hangzhou.",不知道大家记不记得，就在前年年底和去年年初，杭州曾经有过一辆保时捷卡宴撞死撞伤17人的案件。
The perpetrator behind this was driving under the influence of drugs.,而这个背后的肇事者，就是毒驾。
You might wonder why driving under the influence of narcotics can cause such a devastating outcome.,你说：“毒驾为什么会这样？究竟是什么原因？”
I want to share some stories from my interviews.,我来举几个我自己亲身采访和经历的案子。

"After conducted some physical checks, no abnormalities were found in the indicators, and the young woman seemed to be mentally sane, then the doctor asked her: ""Have you taken something unusual?""",去查了一些指标以后，发现她并没有其他的器质性的变化，也没有精神上的特别大的一些不一样的地方，就问她说，“你有没有吃过什么东西？”
"""No, everything is normal."" The young lady responded.",女孩儿说：“没有啊，我一切正常！”
The doctor went on asking her whether she had taken health supplements.,然而医生再问她，说：“你有没有服过什么保健品？”
"In retrospect, she told the doctor she had taken some pills ten months ago.",她想了想，十个月前，我曾经服用过这个东西。
"The doctor conducted tests on the pills and discovered its main ingredient was methylamphetamine, also known as meth.",于是就把这个东西拿来跟医生看了，一化验，主要的成分：甲基苯丙胺，冰毒。
"To be honest, she was not good-looking during her first interview with me.",这个女孩子在我看到她第一次做采访的时候，很坦白地说，她不是一个好看的女孩儿了。
"However, I remembered she was elegant and pretty when I looked at her previous photos.",但是我看到她的照片，应该还是一个非常端庄秀丽的女孩儿。
Why is that?,为什么？
Because she had to take hormonal and anti-depressive drugs to suppress her hallucinations.,因为如果你先要抑制住她的幻听、幻觉、幻视，你必须要服用一些激素类的、抗精神抑郁的药。
"Her doctor told me:"" She can no longer be what she was before she took the pills.""",而她的主治大夫告诉我说：“事实上，这个女孩子不可能再恢复到她之前的状态。”
What exactly are new synthetic drugs?,新型毒品究竟是什么？
"Opium and heroin, to put them in common saying, are green, as they are extracted from plants.",简单地来说，鸦片、白粉、海洛因，我用特别民间的说法，那还是绿色的，因为它是从植物里提炼出来的。
"However, those new drugs are chemically synthesized, which directly affect the central nervous system.",可是新型毒品，它完全是化学合成品，它直接作用于我们的中枢神经。
"Once you take them, the drugs will start damaging your body bit by bit, until it collapses.",也就是说，如果你一旦服用，水滴石穿，有一天一旦穿了，那就是覆水难收。
"Some of my friends asked me:"" Is it that easy to get your hands on drugs? Why don't I see anyone selling and using drugs?""",也许有朋友会问我说：“这么容易就得到毒品吗？为什么我周围就看不见呢？也没有人。”
That's because we haven't been paying enough attention.,那是因为我们没有潜下心来。
"In June, Shandong province has cracked the largest case to date, in which the criminal used Contac to make narcotics.",六月份的时候，山东破获了一起迄今为止最大的一起“新康泰克毒品案”。
"Contac is a common drug for cold, right?",大家感冒都吃康泰克，对吧？
"When you go to the pharmacy now, you can only buy two boxes at a time.",但你现在去药店发现，康泰克只能两盒一卖了，不给你了。
Why is that?,为什么？
"Because one of Contac's ingredients, ephedrine, is a methamphetamine analogue. Therefore, a sneaky criminal gang stockpiled the anti-cold pills for the illicit manufacture of meth.",因为有那么一个“聪明”的团伙，买了许多的康泰克，康泰克中有一样成分叫做麻黄碱，它其实就是甲基苯丙胺的提炼的一个元素。
"I was puzzled at that time, as Contac was not an affordable drug to come by, how would the drug makers profit from that?",我当时也特别纳闷儿，我觉得那康泰克，不便宜呀，这个他还能有利润吗？
The police officers later explained to me that the substance extracted from every 180 yuan of Contac could be sold for up to 500 yuan.,后来警官告诉我说：“180块钱的康泰克中提炼出来的毒物质，可以卖到五百块钱。”
The temptation of exorbitant profit.,这就是暴利的诱惑！
"Currently, more and more drug-selling and profit-seeking criminal are having their eyes fixated on people just like our audience, why?",而现在越来越多的这样的贩毒暴利集团，把目光死死地盯住了在座的各位，为什么？
"That's because many of you are professionals, white-collar workers, and even the elites, who are under immense work-related pressure and have to deal with many problems in life.",你们大多数都是职业人，白领、精英或者是金领，你们工作压力很大，生活中有各种各样的烦恼。
"And this type of people are often well-educated, with a little arrogance.",而且读过书，有一点点的小自负。
"They tend to believe they have self-control and strong will power, and that they can resist being addicted to drugs.",于是你们不相信说，有什么东西是能够抗衡住我的，我是一个有自制力的，有意志力的人。
"When something has become a trend in your social circle, a symbol of fashion, you will come to know it at a certain moment.",当一样东西它成为一种圈子的标志，成为一种时尚的象征，也许，你也可能在某一个时刻就会碰到它！
"On Monday, I visited a correctional institution in Shanghai and interviewed a person going through mandatory drug rehabilitation, who used to be an outstanding dancer.",周一的时候我去上海劳教所，采访了一位这个现在的我们强戒的人员，他曾经是上海非常优秀的一位编舞的舞蹈家。
"I asked him:""Why did you start to use drugs?""",我问他我说：“你你为什么会吸这个东西？”
"He said:""Mengxiao, if you were me, you would do the same. At a social gathering with a dozon of people, when everyone else was taking the drug, you could only refuse once or twice. If you say no for the third time, you would be crossed off the guest list, because you were a wierdo in their eyes.",他说：“梦晓，如果你是我，你也会的！一个聚会十几个人大家都碰了，你不碰，一次可以，两次可以，第三次人家就不会邀请你了，因为你是怪物，你不是我的同道中人。”
"""The drug would bring me inspirations, and keep me excited."" He added.",而且，他说：“那个东西会带给我灵感，因为我非常的亢奋。”
"Well, that's precisely the next point I come to tell you which is about the harmfulness of new synthetic drugs.",好，亢奋的下一点，就是我要来跟大家进一步地介绍，新型毒品的危害性，是什么？
It is the most direct and common channel for spreading AIDS.,它是艾滋病现在最最直接的一个流行通道。
"In the past, people contracted AIDS through injection of heroin and opium, and this kind of circulation was between addicts.",如果说过去的白粉、海洛因、鸦片它通过注射传染艾滋病，它只是说是瘾君子之间的一种一种流通。
"But now, what's like to take new synthetic drugs?",而现在，新型合成毒品是什么感觉？
They stimulate excitement.,它是兴奋作用。
"That's why we would see people shaking their heads in the dance floor after taking ecstasies, or as our host put it, getting high.",所以我们会看到有人吃了摇头丸以后，会在舞厅里边大肆地摇头，high，刚才我们主持人说high，是。
"So, when somebody proposes to take some trendy drugs at a party or a social event, it would very likely lead to collective fornication, which ultimately, would facilitate the spread of AIDS.",所以当一个party或者是一个聚会中，有人开始倡议说我们去吃这种特别时尚的东西的时候，就有可能导致集体淫乱，而最后的结果，则就有可能导致艾滋病的传播。
"The reason why I'm here today to share with you these heart-wrenching stories is that I'm afraid that one day, for whatever reasons, my friends and family could lose their lives to drugs.",所以我今天站在这里，来和大家做这个分享，是真的害怕有一天，我的挚爱亲朋，有人因为这样或者那样的原因，有可能就从此和生命要擦肩而过。
I don't think that will be the outcome you the audience and I want to face.,我相信这一定不是在座的想看到的。
I don't expect to persuade you with everything I just said in 20 minutes.,我不指望二十分钟的时间，能够让大家完全认同或者接受我刚才所说的一切。
"You may still have doubts, and that's alright.",甚至有可能你打着问号，没关系。

"It has been lurking around us, and its name is new synthetic drug.",它是恶魔一样的还在我们的周围，那就是新型合成毒品。
It can be disguised as cold medicine or even as health supplement pills.,它可能会出现在我们的感冒药中，可能会出现在我们的这个所谓的保健品里。
I have two pieces of advice for you.,所以两个忠告给大家。
"First, don't purchase any questionable products through the Internet or word-of-mouth, no matter how effective they can be in making a man strong and a woman beautiful.",第一个忠告，任何一种口口传播的、网上销售的三无产品，不管它告诉你如何能够让男人强健、让女人美丽，请不要碰它。
"Second, when you ever feel lonely and upset, and you don't have a friend to talk to, please dial this number: 62780792.",第二点，在你觉得孤单寂寞，或者在你觉得不快乐的时候，在你觉得没有朋友可以交流的时候，记住一个电话：62780792。
"A phone call might be useless, or it might just be the thing that saves your life.",没用，但是那一刻，也许它是你的一根救命稻草。
"Thank you for sharing, thank you all.",再次谢谢所有朋友们的分享，谢谢大家！
"Recently people keep asking me, ""Why did you quit your job as a journalist and choose to join in the 'Veterans Returning Home' charity campaign ?""",嗯，最近一直会有人问我一个问题，说你为什么要辞去记者的职务，去从事老兵回家的公益活动？

"And today, my topic is also related to the theme of the exposition, ""Better City, Better Life"" .",但是，我今天所要谈论的话题，真的是跟我们世博会的主题是有关的，叫“城市让生活更美好”。
But is it true that a better city brings a better life?,但是城市，真的能让生活更美好吗？
"Hence, I named my speech ""Cooperation or Confrontation"", which may be odd to you.",所以我起了个名字，这个名字可能你看起来有点奇怪，叫“合作，还是对抗”。
"Six years ago when Expo 2010 was widely publicized, there was another grave news which you may forget, and the news was lasting for a whole year.",六年前就在我们报道世博会的时候呢，其实诸位可能忘了吧，当年也有一个非常重要的新闻，发生了持续的一年。
"The news happened to a quite well-known company, Foxconn.",它发生在一个非常著名的公司，叫富士康。
"At that time, over a dozen Foxconn's employees jumped to their death one after another.",富士康连续出现了十几连跳。
"Not only at its headquarters in Shenzhen, but also at its plants in many other regions, such as Langfang, Hebei and Sichuan, many of its employees jump off a building.",而且这十几连跳不仅是在深圳的总部，它在它的廊坊，河北廊坊，在四川，在很多地方都出现了员工的跳楼。
"As a journalist, I wanted to look into the news so I paid a special visit to Foxconn.",我作为一个记者，要对这个事情进行一番关注，于是我专门去了富士康。
"We all know that all the plants of Foxconn in spite of different locations share the same feature, the huge number of workers.",富士康我们知道，不同地方的厂区都有一个特征，人很多。
I visited one of its plant in Shenzhen and found a surprising number.,在深圳的一个厂区，我进入了以后，这个数字让你吓得惊人。
"There were 420,000 employees.",它竟然有42万人。
"420,000 workers lived and worked in a giant Foxconn plant.",42万人在一个巨大的富士康厂里面在居住。
"We often suspected that Foxconn might be cruel to its workers, offering them slender salaries, forcing them to manage heavy workload, or ruling them with an iron fist.",我们总在说富士康是不是因为是一个黑心工厂啊，它这个给的工资很低啊，工作强度很大啊，监管很严哪。
"However, I would like to tell you, the suspicion against Foxconn is disproved.",我跟您说，您可能还真的误解了富士康。
Foxconn in fact offers great benefits to many employees.,富士康其实对很多员工的待遇还不错。
"It even prepares very professional swimming pools for many employees, and free art centers, cost-effective canteens, many convenient cinemas and stores as well, so that plenty of employees can enjoy a better life.",它甚至还为很多员工准备了非常专业的游泳池，可以免费的文艺中心，极其廉价的食堂，还有很多非常方便的电影院和小卖部，都可以让很多的员工，去进行的他们的生活。
"While many media were talking about the potential deprivation that Foxconn did to its workers, I carried out an in-depth investigation and came to a conclusion.",所以在所有记者都在说富士康可能会存在那样那样的压榨工人的情况下，我对富士康做了一个更深入的调查。
"Of course my conclusion couldn't cover all the reasons behind the jumps, but I think it may be one of the factors.",当然我得出的一个结论，不能够涵盖那十几连跳所有的原因，但是我认为它可能是一个原因。
"Have you noticed that the majority of the 420,000 residents of  the Foxconn city were post-80s and post-90s.",诸位你们有没有注意到，一个拥有四十二万人的富士康城里面，大多都是八零后和九零后。
"To my knowledge, people who live in such city for long would know nothing but competition and confrontation.",我认为，人们在这样的城市呆的时间长了，它只有竞争，只有对抗。
A real nice city should have the feature of being age-friendly.,在真正的一个好的城市当中，我们形容有一个词汇叫age friendly。
"Literally, it means being nice to all age groups.",叫年龄友好型。
"An age-friendly city should consist of elders, young adults and children.",也就是说一个城市当中应该有老人，有青年人和孩子。
"If the senior find it despondent, the moment when they see children, they see hope.",当老年人觉得绝望的时候，他会看到孩子、看到希望。
"If they are pessimistic about their life, on the verge of breakdown, young adults would realize that everyone can ride out the storm when seeing elders.",当青年人感觉到自己生活遇到悲观，让自己觉得觉得也有点崩溃的时候，他看到老人，他会觉得那样多的沧桑，不也度过了吗？
Being age-friendly is an important philosophy of governing communities as well as cities.,Age friendly这是一个重要的社区的治理的理念，也是一个城市的重要的理念。
"My aunt passed away, hmm, two months ago.",我的姑姑前两嗯前两个月去世了。
"She used to be cheerful and helpful, willing to help neighbors with all kinds of problems.",她曾经在社区里是一个非常愉快的、乐于助人的、愿意管街坊邻里各种闲事儿的。
She played a very active role in her community.,诶街道的积极分子。
"Later, arranged by the family, she lived in a nursing home.",但是当我们给她安安排在养老院去居住的时候。
"I met her after she had been in nursing home for six months, and she seemed like a different person.",半年以后她遇到我，她状态跟以前完全不一样。
"She sighed: ""Luo Xin, human are doomed to die, and I will die sooner or later.""",她跟我说：“哎呀，这骆新啊，人反正是都是要死的，我早晚是要死的。”
She said so because two of her four roommates had gone successively.,因为跟她同一个屋子的四个老人，已经有两个先后去世了。
The death indeed had an impact on her.,这对她来说，难道不是一种影响吗？
"Likewise, the 420,000, or even millions of, young workers in Foxconn were trapped in a similar situation.",同样，四十二万人所在的富士康，甚至是几百万人所在的富士康。
"The young residents may be haunted by competition, for they can't see elders or kids but only competitors.",这里面所有的年轻人，他们想到的可能更多的，他看不见老人看不见孩子，他们看到的只有他自己的竞争者。
The only ambition of competitors is to win.,竞争者所面临的唯一的那就是我要赢过你。
"Probably, the victims felt abandoned and valueless due to a lost opportunity, a lost game or even the criticism from leaders.",谁能说那十几跳的员工们不存在着由于他们失掉了某种机会，输掉了某一场比赛，甚至被领导给骂了一番，他觉得他被抛弃和被放弃了。
Do you know what is the greatest pain for human beings?,各位，你们知道人的最大痛苦是什么吗？
It is not death.,不是死亡。
"The first is feeling guilty, and the second is feeling abandoned and valueless.",第一痛苦，愧疚，第二痛苦，被抛弃和被放弃。
"Therefore, the city we are going to talk about today is the current physical environment we live in, a visible city.",所以我们今天要探讨的这城市，就是我们今天所生活的这样的物理环境，那是你看得见的城市。
"When you stand in front of an enormous plant or a towering building, do you ever feel that you are so small and of no account?",所以当你在一个巨大的厂房里面或者在一个巨大的高楼面前，你有没有一种感觉，你觉得你自己很渺小，你很不重要。
"If you are asked to choose between New York and Hawaii as a place of residence, I bet most would prefer the latter.",如果一定要让你在纽约哼跟夏威夷选择一个居住地的话，我相信很多人更愿意选择夏威夷。
"There, in Hawaii, without many high rises, people may retain their human dignity.",因为在那里没有太多多高楼大厦，在那里可能人们他有一种人的尊严感。
"In 1961, famous Jane Jacobs, an American-Canadian lady, published her book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities.",在1961年，有一位非常著名的、美国的也是后来加入加拿大国籍的叫简·雅各布森，这个老太太写了本书叫《美国大城市的死与生》。
"In her work, Jane Jacobs for the first time criticized metropolises and non-age-friendly cities.",这本书，简·雅各布森第一次对大城市，包括对那种缺乏age friendly的城市提出了批评。
She argued that those cities are unfavourable to human survival.,她认为这样的城市，不利于人们的生存。
"For instance, Jane Jacobs visited many CBDs specially.",举个例子，简·雅各布森专门到了很多的CBD去看了一下。
She realized that CBDs were packed with workers at daytime yet empty at nights. No one stay in CBDs over night.,她发现CBD啊，白天人山人海，所有人都在工作，但到晚上CBD没人了，成了一座空城。
"Furthermore, many service providers, and small and middle-sized companies as well, saw CBDs as opportunities.",不仅如此，而且很多的服务商，包括中小企业和服务者们都认为CBD这是个机会。
"Thus, restaurants, print stores and laundries entered CBDs.",所以餐馆进驻了、打印店进驻了、洗衣房进驻了。
"Unfortunately, before long, restaurants, laundries and other service providers left CBDs.",可是都坚持不了多久，这些餐馆、洗衣房和服务商门纷纷都撤出CBD。
Why?,为什么？
"Everyone, do you know why?",各位，你们想过吗？
Not only the high rents but also the periodic traffic in CBDs resulted in their withdrawal.,不仅是因为房屋价格高，因为CBD这个地方具有人的潮汐的周期性。
Most people go to CBDs by day for work and leave after 5pm.,大量的人是白天来这上班，五点钟以后就离开了。
"Look, this is a CBD in Beijing, Dabeiyao.",你看，这是北京的CBD，大北窑。
"During the Chinese New Year holidays, Dabeiyao keeps this status for ten days.",春节期间它长期保持十天这样的情况。
"Hence, a lot of small and middle-sized companies in CBDs can generate revenue with high markups, but they can only do it once a day.",所以大量的中小企业在这里生活它只能挣到一笔钱，可能这笔钱利润很高。
"Restaurants, laundries and print stores can make money during days but have nothing to do at evenings and nights.",但它只能挣到一顿饭的钱，一次洗衣的钱，一次复印的线，它想到晚上，它没有事儿干了。
There are many small restaurants in urban residential areas.,本来我们在城里很多的小的餐馆，
"Those restaurants offers not only lunches but also dinners, midnight snacks and even breakfasts.",它也许除了你中午做一顿饭，如果你在居民区的话，它还有晚餐、还有夜宵、甚至还有早点。
The restaurants in CBDs realized that in spite of high profits the business hours is too short.,但是这些企业就觉得，固然它的利润高，但是它的整体的营业面儿并不高。
"In other words, in terms of a special concept in the property development industry, their average revenue per unit area is too low.",换句话说，我们用今天的一个房地产商的特殊概念叫频效，它的单位的频效太低了。
"Jane Jacobs thought that was why the life in many American cities, such as Chicago and New York metropolitan area, was expensive but lifeless.",简·雅各布森认为，这是导致美国很多像芝加哥、纽约中心城区最后终于走向昂贵，但却缺乏活力的原因。
"She also suggested that now that there are many streets and squares in cities and these streets and squares should serve workers by day and all citizens during non-working hours, including the old and the young.",雅各布森还说了一个问题，她说我们有很多街道，有很多广场，其实这个广场啊和街道的利用应该是白天上班的人用这条马路，但是到白不上班的时候可能会说有一些嗯年年老者。
Young adults could have a walk with their parents and kids on the streets or in the squares.,年轻人会带着自己的父母、带着自己孩子在马路上转一转。
"Nevertheless, many streets have only one function, serving commuters.",但你会发现有很多马路，它的功效只有一个，就是上班儿。
They just lead commuters to office places.,我每天都在这通勤，只有这一项功能。
Cities have another feature.,当然作为城市还有另外一个特征。
This is a photo of the Red Square in Moscow taken by me.,你看这是我在莫斯科红场所拍的一张照照片。
We all know that every city has squares and squares play a special role in cities. ,我们都知道这个城城市得有广场。
They are the embodiment of the city.,广场得得特别需要体现出一个城市的标志。
But Jane Jacobs believed that many urban squares didn't fit in with human needs.,但简·雅各布森认为有很多这个城市的广场，它不符合人的尺度。
"Mr Liang Sicheng once said to Mao Zedong that the idea of Tiananmen Square was viable, but the size was too big.",梁思成先生当时对毛泽东曾经说过一句话，说你要建天安门广场可以建，但是这个广场太大了。
He reckoned that except for political purposes such a big square could not offer any benefits to ordinary citizens because it didn't meet human needs.,我认为除了政治公用之外它几乎没有什么可以创造我们普通人在上面去进行活动的机会，因为它不符合人的尺度。
The Red Square is not big but still suitable for various military parades.,红场并不大，但是它同样可以接受各种各样的阅兵。
I took the photo with a wide angle lens.,但是你平常要去的话，我这张照片儿还是用的广角拍的哦。
"If you visit the Red Square by person, you may be surprised by its small size.",其实你真到红场你会发现红场真小。
It can't even rival any square in China.,它比不上我们国内任何一个广场。
"But the Red Square is full of vitality, surrounded by plenty of ancient buildings.",但是它有人气儿，再者说它旁边还有很多的古老的建筑。
Don't you feel pleasant when you live in and walk around in the building?,你在这个建筑当中生活，走动，你觉得难道不舒服吗？
"Meanwhile, today's cities lay too many emphases on expressway which is prepared for vehicles.",当然还有一点，我们今天的城市太强调快速通道了，快速通道完全是为了汽车所准备的。
What about pedestrians?,行人在哪儿呢？
What about bicycles?,自行车在哪儿呢？
What about electric motorcycles?,电动车在哪儿呢？
And what about motorbikes?,摩托车在哪儿呢？
"No, they are not the service objects of expressway.",都没有啊。
The point is that many major expressways actually undermine the only remaining links in cities.,而且关键是我们很多大的通道是把一个城市本来仅连的这个基底给割断了。
The Madrid of Spain built a ring expressway circling the old city.,在西班牙马德里曾经修了一个环，原来老城的一个高速通道。
Many thought the ring expressway hindered the communication between residents.,但是很多人认为这个通道，阻碍了居民之间正常的交往。
"Say, a grandpa lived in this area, while his grandson lived in another area.",爷爷在在在这儿住，孙子在那儿住。
"They couldn't visit each other as frequently as they used to do because of the ring expressway, thus leading to the weakening ties between families and friends.",结果这个大通道一旦修完，他们以以往所有的沟联都减少了，甚至导致了家人跟亲情和朋友之间的感情变得疏远。
"The Madrid government responded to the public's appeal, removed the ring expressway and built an underground expressway so that the ties in the city was recovered.",马德里市政府，从善如流，把这个环城公路修了拆掉，让它全部从地下走，又重新恢复了整个城市的弥连。
"There is an avenue in Shanghai which I regard as a failure, the Century Avenue.",我们上海有一条大马路，我认为是一个失败的建筑，世纪大道。
"If you go across the avenue, guess how long does it take?",你从这地方过红绿灯走那个地方，你想你花得得花多长时间？
One minute.,一、一分钟。
Beijing built two avenues traversing from east to west to achieve rapid transit.,北京曾经为了进入它的快速交通，它曾经修了两条横贯东西的大通道。
One is Liangguang Avenue; the other is Ping'an Avenue.,一个叫两广大道，一个叫平安大道。
"The two avenues were commercial zones of great significance in Beijing, for they went through Qianmen, Huguo Temple, Drum Tower and Beihai.",两广大道、平安大道在历史上曾经是北京重要的商业区，比如说它穿过前门、穿过护国寺、穿过鼓楼和北海。
"After the completion of the two avenues, however, all the shops along the two streets were going out of business; they had few customers.",这两条快速通道修完后，行了，从此以后这两条大道所有的商家全部都面临消临，没有人去买东西了。
No one would pull over just for ice cream.,谁会停着车在下边还下去去买根冰棍儿去，没有人吃啦。
"Hence, have you noticed that the natural forms of an old city play an important role in our life?",所以你有没有发现，一个城市古老的形态，它有很多自然的形态，对于我们的生活有多么的重要。
Why do human need cities?,人为什么要有城市呢？
"Cheng-shi, the Chinese counterpart of ""city"" consists of ""cheng"" which aims for confrontation and ""shi"" which is for cooperation. Hence, the word ""city"" contains two mutually contradictory meanings.",城，是为了对抗用的；市，是为了合作用。
"Hence, the word ""city"" contains two mutually contradictory meanings.",所以城市这一个词其实包含两种完全不一样的含义。
"In ancient times, cities were built for confrontation, so buildings like the Great Wall, barbicans, Round City and Fujian Tulou were built.",早期城一定是为了对抗用的，比如说长城、瓮城、团城、土楼。
Ancient human relied on cities to defend against enemy and survive.,它对抗外部的势力使得早期的人类，可以在里面可以直接生存。
"Therefore, the design logic behind ancient cities didn't take living quality into consideration.",所以早年的城市其实它的人们的设计的思想，并没有包含更多的生活性。
The city of  Chang'an in Tang dynasty was a complex with many lanes and alleys.,比如说唐代的长安城，长安城是按照坊巷的方式做了很多的建筑。
It was a great city with many residents.,里面有很多的人在生活，确实不错。
"However, in fact the city was not appropriate for living.",但是你要知道这个城市，其实并不真正适合人们生活。
"It was a place accommodating imperial palaces, government organs and key figures, and some civilians.",那只是用来放皇宫，放行政办事机构和一些重要的人物在里面住，当然也包括一些平民。
Did you see the two black dots here?,但是你发现没有，这上面有两个黑点儿。
What do they stand for?,这黑点儿代表什么呢？
"They were the only two markets with special permission in Chang'an, the East Market and the West Market.",是当时长安特别规定的，只有在这个黑的这个区域当中才能进行交易，所以这是长安的东市和西市。
Trading in other areas was forbidden so as to avoid terrorist attacks and safeguard the stable society.,他不允许你在别地方再做做交易，因为怕有恐怖袭击，怕影响整个社会的正常的稳定的秩序。
This kind of city restricted human activities and stressed on defence.,这种把人们框定在城里，并且以抵御为主的城市。
The form of cities changed in Song dynasty.,到中国的宋代发生了改变。
"The work, Along the River During the Qingming Festival, showcases the view of Dianliang. The city also had city walls but most layouts in the city were formed naturally.",你看看清明上河图，尽管它汴梁城也是有城墙的，可是清明上河图更多的展示的是城市里面的机理，它的自然形成。
What is the largest contributor to urban development?,什么是形成城市的最重要的力量？
Market economy.,市场经济。
"Market economy allows cities to grow at their will, though under the guideline of city planning.",市场经济使得这个城市有它自由的选择，尽管这里面也离不开规规划。
"But in a city which conforms to market economy, all walks of life, including pedlars and menial servants, can build connection with others and the connection between people are close.",但是你发现没有，贩夫叟卒各种各样的人都能够在这里面进行交往，甚至人们之间的沟通的距离是不是又近了很多。
The most important criterion for a good city is that the city can lower the cost of cooperation and communication.,一个好的城市的最大的标准是要降低人们的合作成本和沟通成本。
Don't underestimate it.,你真别要去小看这个。
"If you live in different cities, your behavior varies with cities.",甚至你有不同的城市，你的风格都和你的城市的感觉是有关。
"In a city where people are closely connected, you speak and behave in a corresponding way.",这个城市如果人离得近，你的语言和你所有的风格都是以近的方式来说的。
Today's Shanghai has no city walls.,今天的上海其实是没有城墙的上海。
The only cities walls are in City God Temple and have been left unused for long.,我们城墙是目前只保留在城隍庙，但是已经很早不用了。
Shanghai is the only city in China that develops on the basis of market economy and has few city walls.,上海是中国历史上唯一的一个靠市场经济的发展，几乎没有城墙的城市。
"Thus, we can see that various activities take place in Waitan.",所以今天我们会看到，今天的外滩，各种各样的交往。
"The life of Shanghai people is strongly tied to commerce, so the cost of their transportation and communication is lowered.",你可以发哈现在这个城市当中人们的生活完全跟商业紧密相关，人们降低了它们的交通成本、沟通成本。
Do you know the reason why people can maintain long-term cooperation is not the value of individuals but the time they have spent together.,你知道吗，人和人之所以能够长久合作的原因，不是因为你有多少价值，是因为你有时间作为你的背书。
"Yes, admit it.",是吧，你得承认吧。

"Likewise, a nice city should have splendid history as its endorsement.",同样，一个好的城市它是有历史作为它的背书的。
People feel awestruck in front of time-honored historic buildings.,而且人们在这样的历史建筑物面前，他会有一种敬畏感。
"No one is arrogant on that occasion, for they will realize that the figures of much influence in the history are gone, so will they sooner or later.",没有人再会狂躁了，你还狂噪什么，早年那些人全都没了，你有一天你也会没掉。
"Hence, in that environment, people respect others and dispel the sense of superiority in reverence.",所以人们在这样的环境当中，他会更多的出于一种敬畏之心，彼此尊重，打消优越感。
Do those cities lack urban planning?,当然你说这些城市难道没有规划吗？
Of course not.,当然有。
Do cities develop naturally or artificially?,城市究竟是自然发展的，还是由它自然，由人为去规划的？
I think their development are both natural and artificial.,我认为两者都有。
"For example, this is the downtown of ancient Roma.",比如说我们举个例子，当然这是古罗马的市中心。
You will see that ancient Roma was just roughly planned.,你会发现其它其实也没什么太多的这个规划。
"Its government designed a central living room for the city so that residents could communicate in the city center, at the colosseum or bathhouses.",但是它真正的政府做了项规划，它要给创造城市的中心客厅，让人们有机会在中心的城区他们有交流的机会，无论是斗兽场还是澡堂子。
"I have to mention someone, Le Corbusier.",我今天必须得说一个人，这个人叫勒·柯布西耶。
People who study architecture view him as a great architect.,搞建筑的人都认为这人是一个伟大的建筑家。
That's undisputed.,我们一点不反对的。
"Yet, he made a fundamental mistake.",但勒·柯布西耶有个有一个根根本性的问题。
He participated in the formulation of the Athens Charter and expected to make cities functional in 1925 via the Athens Charter.,他曾经是参与了《雅典宪章》的制定，而且并且他在1925年曾经以《雅典宪章》的方式，希望把这个城市变得功能化。
"As you know, today's cities are functional; they consist of CBDs, residential areas and administrative office areas.",你知道今天我们把城市都变成是功能区了，比如说CBD，比如说居住区，比如说行政办公区。
All of them stemmed from the Athens Charter.,这最早其实来自于《雅典宪章》。

"Luckily, his plan was denied, or we would never have today's Paris.",幸亏勒·柯布西耶这个方案被否决了，否则你将今天看不到今天的巴黎。
"But his idea of functional city has affected architects, for at least a century.",但是功能化的思路却影响了我们人们对城市的一辈子的思考，至少是这100年的思考。
A real well-performing city should be diversified.,真正好的城市是应该变成组团制的。
"I don't go against functional areas, but I think it is more important to integrate residential areas, living areas, office areas and commercial areas to decrease the cost of transportation and communication as much as possible, or to gain the most with the least cost.",这个里面我不反对有功能划分，但是我个人认为更重要的是，应该把它的居住、生活、办公、商业、让它尽可能减少它的这出行，或者说以很少的成本、很少的沟通成本就可以获得它最高的效益。
The solution to traffic jam is not just traffic dispersion or the construction of parking lots.,所以道路拥堵，那不是靠你排堵保畅，和建这么几个停车楼可以去完成的。
The problem of traffic jam lies in urban design.,你建设城市的整体思路出了问题。
"Therefore, the problem of cities is actually the problem of designers.",所以这城市病了，病的不是城市本身，是我们这些人。

Why did he say so?,为什么没到？
"He said: ""I know Shandong like a book. The Jinan Railway Station was originally built by Fischer. It has an amazing bell tower. The bell tower with a large roof which looks like a hat is very beautiful. I haven't the bell tower yet, so we can't be at the Jinan Railway Station.""",于洋说：“我对山东太熟啦，济南火车站是1904年由德国人菲舍尔建的，那有一个非常漂亮的钟楼，带个大帽子的这钟楼特别漂亮，所以我还没看到这钟楼，所以肯定没到济南火车站。”
"Yet, the man told him the old railway station has been torn down.",那个人告诉他说，这济南火车站已经拆了。
"On hearing that, Mr Yu Yang froze at his seat, completely dumbfounded.",于洋先生坐在车厢里半晌说不出一句话来。

"In the city where consumerism and authoritarianism co-exist, human reason must be weak, so people there focus more on competition than cooperation.",只要是消费主义跟威权主义并存的地方，人们的理性一定会变得少，于是你们的合作精神就远远要低于你们的对抗的勇气。

Thank you.,谢谢大家。
We've introduced the application of Baidu Translate and how to use Baidu API. You may be curious about the technologies behind machine translation. ,刚才我们讲了百度翻译的应用以及如何使用百度API，那么大家可能很感兴趣的是那翻译背后的技术是怎么样的呢？
Now let’s take a closer look at the technologies behind Baidu Translate. ,下面我们就来讲一讲百度翻译背后的技术。
"Speaking of machine translation, let's go back to the year of 1946 when the world's first computer was born.",额提到翻译呢其实我们不得不提到在1946年的时候，世界上第一台计算机诞生。
Only after the computer has been created could we realize machine translation. ,因为只有计算机有了计算机以后，我们才能够利用计算机进行翻译。
"At that time, a talented scientist conceived the idea that we could translate via computer. ",其实当时就有一个天才的科学家他在想，计算机有了，我们是不是可以利用计算机来进行翻译。
"In 1947, an American scientist published a memorandum on translation and raised the question whether we can use computers for translation.",在1947年，美国的科学家发表了一篇翻译的备忘录，提到了我们能不能利用计算机来进行翻译。
"Machine translation in fact is an interdiscipline that involves computer knowledge, information theory, cognitive science and linguistics.",那么实际上机器翻译是一个交叉学科，它不仅需要利用计算机的知识，还需要利用信息论、认知科学、语言学等等。
"Over the past seventy years since 1947, many machine translation methods have been proposed.",那么从47年到现在也差不多经历了70年的时间，在这70年之间涌现出了许多机器翻译的方法。
"For example, at the beginning there was rule-based machine translation. For rule-based machine translation, we have linguists summarize linguistic phenomena, write linguistic rules and compile them into computer-readable forms, enabling computers to translate.","比如说一开始基于规则的机器翻译，所谓基于规则的机器翻译是说我们找一些人类的语言学家来总结语言现象，写语言规则，把它放到计算机里面去，变成计算机可懂的语言,进行翻译。"
"Obviously if we do multilingual translation in this way, we need linguists of different languages. The cost of development is explicitly high. So it becomes less used.",这种方法显而易见，如果我们进行多语言的翻译，就需要找不同的语言学家来进行写，那么开发成本非常高，后来啊用的是也比较少。
"In the 1980s, example-based machine translation came into being.",到了80年代，涌现出了基于实例的翻译方法。
"Example-based machine translation is based on an idea that when we learn a language, we may not care too much about its grammar.",所谓基于实例的翻译方法是说，我们人在学习一种语言的时候，可能并不太关心里面的语法是什么。
"Instead we aquire language intuition, or idiomatic expressions, or syntax through extensive reading, and naturally build a translation model.",那么我们就通过阅读大量的阅读来获取这样的语感也好，表达习惯也好，句式也好，那么自然而然地就有了这样一个建立起这样一个翻译的这样一个嗯模型。
"For example, we have a Chinese sentence meaning ""please give me a cup of water"" and we have its English translation.",比如说有一个句子是说“请给我拿一杯水”，那么有对应的英文翻译。
"So if we need to translate another sentence ""Please give me a pen"", we can simply replace ""a cup of water"" with ""a pen"" , and get a syntactically similar target sentence. It is the primary idea of example-based machine translation.",那么如果我们要翻译另外一个句子“请给我拿一个钢笔”，那么只要我们把水替换成钢笔，把相应的英语中的呃water替换成pen，那么这个句式也是相通的，所以这是基于实例的机器翻译的一个主要思想。
"In the 1990s, some scientists from IBM came up with the idea of statistical machine translation. It is the mainstream method of machine translation so far.",到了90年代以后，啊IBM的一些科学家提出了统计机器翻译的思想，这一个思想是一直到目前为止，呃是一个主流的翻译方法。
"For tatistical machine translation, we build the translation model using massive bilingual data, from which we abstract the mathematical model of the relationship between the source language and the target language.",所谓统计机器翻译是说我们利用大量的双语的数据来建立翻译模型，然后啊抽象出呃数学模型，建立起源语言和目标语言之间的关系。
"Combined with the Internet, statistical machine translation became very powerful.",那么尤其是与互联网结合以后，统计机器翻译便发挥出了巨大的威力。
The research of statistical machine translation prevailed until 2014.,这一主流的诶研究趋势一直持续到2014年。
The method of neural machine translation was proposed in 2014. So far it is a research hotspot and has made great improvement in translation quality compared with statistical machine translation. ,2014年的时候提出了神经网络机器翻译方法，这是目前为止大家一个研究的热点，并且翻译质量较统计机器翻译也有了一个大幅的提高。
"I need to point out here that in the time of rule-based machine translation, that is, in the middle and late 1970s, commercial rule-based translation software ",这里面需要提到的是在基于规则的时代，呃在70年代中后期出现了基于规则的商业的翻译软件。
Online statistical translation systems emerged around 2006.,那么在2006年左右出现了基于统计的互联网的翻译系统。
They are two types of machine translation software at different times.,这代表了两种两个不同时期的一个翻译软件。
"Neural machine translation, as mentioned earlier, was just a lab trial back in 2014 and was far from industrial application.",那么到2014年刚才提到了提出了神经网络机器翻译，当时还是在实验室中的一个产物，如果把它应用到工业上去，还是有很长的路要走。
"Take statistical machine translation for example. It was proposed around 1991, but was not applied in online translation systems until 2006, which is 15 years later.",比如说以统计机器翻译为例，它是在1991年左右提出来的，但是真正的大规模的应用到互联网的翻译系统是在2006年，这中间经历了15年。
"How long did it take for neural machine translation to go from lab to industry, after it was proposed in 2014.",那么14年提出了神经网络机器翻译以后，从实验室走到工业界，这个时间是多长？
It was in less than a year that Baidu launched the world's first neural machine translation system.,不到一年的时间，那么百度呢推出了世界上第一个神经网络翻译系统。
Companies such as Google launched their neural machine translation systems later in September 2016.,随后到了2016年的9月份，谷歌等公司也推出了自己的神经网络翻译系统。
"As mentioned earlier, there is a great deal of data available online after the internet emerged.",刚才提到了互联网出现以后，网络上有大量的可以使用的数据。
"It's big data, like most people like to refer it as. For example, we can mine translation data from hundreds of billions of webpages, and tens of minllions of terms from authoritative dictionaries.",现在很多人提到的一个大数据，比如说我们可以从互联网上挖掘到数千亿网页的翻译语料以及千万量级的一些权威的词典词条。
"In the meantime, catchphrases and buzzwords spring up online, which need to be updated timely.",同时啊互联网上还会涌现出一些网络的热词、流行语，这些是需要及时更新的。
"Bilingual texts, authoritative dictionaries and catchphrases and buzzwords constitute our major training data for translation.",这三种呃一个是双语语料，一个是权威词典，还有一些网络热词、流行语，构成了我们一个翻译的呃主要的训练数据。
"On this basis, we take measures like denoising, detecting new words to process the data and get a high quality translation corpus.","在此基础上，我们通过一些去去除噪音以及新词的检测,一些加工，就得到了一个高质量的翻译知识库。"
"There are various demands for online translation services, for example, there are demands for translating poems, essays, news and patents, as well as in-chat translating.",互联网的翻译需求其实是多种多样的，比如说我们有诗歌的翻译需求，有论文的翻译需求，有新闻的翻译需求，专利的需求，还有一些聊天儿的需求等等等等。
"It's plainly impossible to meet all the demands with a single translation system or model. Therefore, Baidu Translate integrates multiple strategies to its translation system.",单单靠一种翻译系统或者是模型，显然无法解决这个问题，所以百度翻译实际上是一个多策略融合的翻译系统。
"For instance, we have rule-based machine translation, example-based machine translation, statistical machine translation and the currently prevailing neural machine translation. ",比如说我们既有基于规则的方法，也有基于实例的方法，也有统计的方法，也有现在流行的基于神经网络的翻译方法。
These translation methods draw on each other's merits and give full play to superiority so as to address different translation needs and generate high quality translation in the end. ,这些翻译方法互相取长补短，发挥各自的优势，应对不同的翻译需求，最终产生高质量的翻译结果。
Now let me briefly introduce the respective advantages of these translation methods.,下面我就来简单地分别介绍一下这些方法它们的优势。
"Firstly statistical machine translation. As we mentioned before, statistical machine translation is based on massive bilingual data training. ",比如统计机器翻译，刚才提到了统计机器翻译建立在大量的双语数据训练基础上。
Let's see the two textboxes on the top. The left textbox shows some bilingual data. The first sentence is in Chinese. The second one is in English. Here we use Chinese to English translation as example to introduce statistical machine translation. We can see they are in one-to-one alignment. ,比如说最上面两个框，左边是一个双语的数据，第一句是汉语，第二句是英语，我们以汉英为例来介绍统计机器翻译，那么它是一句对一句、一一对应的。
"On the right are English-only data, which we refer to as monolingual data. The data on the left are referred to as bilingual parallel data.",右边则是单纯的英语，我们叫它单语数据，左边呢我们叫双语平行数据。
"Through statistical analysis, we can build a translation model using the data on the left. For instance, we can align the words in blue and those in red.",通过一些统计分析，我们可以从左边的数据中建立出翻译模型，比如说我标蓝的字和标红的字可以建立对应关系。
"For example, ""wo yao gaosu"" is a fragment in Chinese,  and its english conterpart is ""I will tell"". ""Ni"" can be translated as ""you"". The alignment can be done automatically.",啊比如说“我要告诉”这样是一个短语，那么英文是I will tell，“你”可以翻译成you，这些都是可以自动完成的。
"That is to say, on the basis of the bilingual texts, we can establish the relationship between the source language and the target language. So   translation model is working more like a bridge.",也就是说通过这个双语文本，我们可以建立起于源语言和目标语言之间的关系，所以翻译模型更像是一个桥梁的作用。
Then on the right we have a language model. The language model measures the fluency of target language.,那么右边这个是一个语言模型，语言模型衡量的是目标语言产生以后它的一种流畅度。
"For example, we can have a sentence like ""I am a student"" which is a pefect English utterance.",比如说我们可以说“I am a student”，那这是一个良好的表达，符合英语的习惯。
"However, ""I is a student"" is ungrammatical.",但如果说“I is a student”，这是有语法错误的。
"The language model can tell that ""I am a student"" is more fluent than ""I is a student"" and give the former a higher score.",语言模型就可以判断出来，“I am a student”比“I is a student”更流畅，前者的得分更高。
"With the translation model, which plays the role of bridge, and the language model, which measures the fluency of the target language, we are able to translate.",那么通过翻译模型，它建立了一个桥梁作用，和语言模型，它它来衡量目标语言的流畅度，我们就可以进行翻译了。
"For example, here I have a new sentence ""wo yao gaosu ni yige gushi"". It is never seen in our training data. But we have seen these fragments.",比如说我这里有一个新的句子——“我要告诉你一个故事”，这在我们的训练数据中是没有从来没有出现过的，但是这些片段我们是见过的。
"For example, ""wo yao gaosu"" can be translated as ""I will tell"", ""ni"" as ""you"", ""yige"" as ""a"", and  ""gushi"" as ""story"". Then we put them together and get an English sentence ""I will tell you a story""",比如说我要告诉啊可以是“I will tell”，“你”翻译成“you”，一个翻译成“a”，故事对应“story”，那么我们通过组合就可以得到英文的译文“I will tell you a story”。
"But actually, we have more complicated strategies than this. ",但是在实际呃应用场景中，啊其实还是有一些比这个更复杂的策略在里面。
"For instance, in conventional Chinese, sentences have different word order from English ones. So we need a process of reordering.",比如说汉语的表达习惯，句句子的顺序跟英语的句子顺序通常是不太一样的，这里面就有一个调序的过程。
"In addition, statistical machine translation, as we mentioned, is built on the basis of massive training data, we have massive training data in Chinese and English.",另外在统计机器翻译里面，我们刚才说它是建立在大量的训练语料基础上的，像中文和英文我们有大量的训练数据。
"But bilingual data in less popular language pairs, such as Chinese and Thai, Chinese and Japanese, Chinese and Korean, are not so much in number, or even scarce.",但是有一些很小的偏门的语种，比如说像中文和泰文、中文和日文、中文和韩文，它们的双语数据并不是很大，甚至是非常的稀缺。
In this case what can we do? Can we still use the method of statistical machine translation?,这个时候那么我们怎么办呢，是不是仍然可以利用统计机器翻译的方法来进行翻译？
The answer is yes.,那答案也是肯定的。
"We proposed the pivot language approach for machine translation. Generally speaking, a pivot language is the third language introduced as an intermediary.",我们提出了基于枢轴语言的翻译方法，所谓枢轴语言，其实我们就是通俗的来讲，就是引入了另外第三种语言，来作为桥梁。
"For example, we have a great deal of Chinese to English and English to Thai bilingual data. We can build a Chinese to English translation model and a English to Thai translation model seperately. ",比如说我们有大量的中英的双语数据，以及英语和泰语的双语数据，我们可以各自构建中英的翻译模型和英泰的翻译模型。
We can use English as the intermediary and build a translation model for Chinese and Thai through deduction. And so we can build a translation system for Chinese and Thai.,这中间以英语作为桥梁，通过一些模型推导，我们就可以建立起中文和泰文的翻译模型，从而也可以实现中文和泰文的翻译系统。
"Thanks to this technology, We can quickly increase the number of luanguages Baidu Translate supports, from 2, Chinese and English, to 28 or even more languages.",那么所以说通过这样一个技术，我们就可以把百度翻译从中文和英文这样两种语言迅速地扩展为28种语言以及更多。
Next I will brief you the rule-based method.,下面简单来介绍一下基于规则的方法。
What is its strength? ,它的长处是什么呢？
It's that we can easily summarize rules and apply them to translation systems.,是说我们能够很容易地总结出一些规律性的东西，从而把它应用到翻译系统当中去。
Let's see two examples.,这里展示了两个例子。
"In the first sentence, the part in blue is a date ""September 28th, 2015"".",比如第一句话，我飘蓝的字体是一个日期：2015年9月28日。
"In Chinese, we usually express a date in the order of year, month, day, while in western style the order is month, day, year. So we can have a reordering in the English translation to make it idiomatic.",汉语呢我们通常来说是年月日的表达，在一些西方国家通常是月日年的表达，那么我们可以把汉语的时间顺序进行一下调整，啊调整成符合英语表达习惯的这样一个顺序。
"The following example is a case of translating a number, say three hundred and eighty. We can easily write some rules about how to correctly translate three hundred and eighty.",下面这个例子展示了一个数字的翻译，比如说三百八十，那么我们可以很容易地写出一些规则，三百八十该如何翻译成正确的英文。
This is an advantage of rule-based method.,所以这是基于规则的方法的一个长处。
"Next is a demonstration of example-based machine translation. It is good at translating new words, proverbs, buzzwords and idioms. ",下面展示一下基于实例的方法，它通常所比较擅长的翻译是一些新词、俗语、呃热词以及习惯表达。
Usually they can not be translated word by word. Free translation is needed.,通常是一些我们没有办法说一个字一个字的来翻译，它通常是一些意译的翻译。
"For example, here is a catch phrase ""No zuo no die"". How do we translate it?",比如这个是前两年一个比较流行的句子，“不作死就不会死”，那么这个怎么来翻呢？
It's really difficult. ,显然是很难来翻的。
A proper translation was worked out and included in an American urban dictionary. ,后来就有人总结出来了一个翻译的方法，当然这个翻译啊也被美国的一个城市词词典所收录了。
"It's really difficult, no matter what translation method is used.",这无论用任何一种翻译方法都是很难做出来的。
So we put it in our training data.,所以啊我们把它放到我们的训练数据中去。
"When we encounter the same sentence, we directly fetch the translation in the data and present it to users.",如果发现了这样一个句子，我们就直接把它的译文拿出来，嗯呈现给嗯用户就可以了。
This is an application scenario of example-based machine translation.,这是基于实例的方法的一个应嗯应用场景。
Finally let's look at neural machine translation that rises in recent two years.,最后是近两年兴起的一个神经网络机器翻译。
"In statistic machine translation, which we mentioned earlier, we actually segment source texts into different fragments such as ""I will tell"", ""you"".",刚才提到的像统计机器翻译，大家看到实际上是把源语言切成了不同的片段，比如说“我要告诉”、“你”等等这样一些片段。
"As I mentioned, when we put the fragments together in the process of translation, we may need to rearrange their order, and we may encounter problems like the absence of context.",正如我刚才提到的，这些片段在组合成为译文的时候，会有一些语序的调整，以及一些上下文嗯不可见这样的一些情况。
Neural machine translation is free from such problems. It encodes  the entire source texts at first and outputs the translation after numerous iterations and abstractions.,那么在神经网络机器翻译里面，它是不存在这些问题的，它会首先对源语言进行一个整体的编码，经过神经网络的层层迭代和抽象最后啊输出译文。
It's similar to human translation. We usually won't start translating a sentence until we read it through and get its general idea.,这就像人在翻译过程中来看，我们翻译一个句子，通常是把这个句子先读一遍，获得了这个句子的整体信息，然后再对这个句子进行翻译。
"In this way, we are able to make the most of the context and the global information of the sentence. The translation generated is rather complete and in a proper word order.",这样我们就能够充分地利用句子的上下文以及全局的信息，最后生成的译文也比较完整，并且顺序也比较符合目标语言的表达顺序。
This is an advantage of neural machine translation.,所以这是神经网络机器翻译它的优点。
"Like I said before, neural machine translation was proposed in 2014 by a laboratory.",正如我刚才提到的，神经网络机器翻译实际上在2014年是刚刚在实验室中被提出来。
"In less than a year, we launched the world's first online neural machine translation system on May 20, 2015.  Neural machine tranlation is known as NMT for short, where N stands for neural. The release of the system ushered in a new chapter of NMT's large-scale application.",那么经过不到一年的时间，在2015年的5月20号，5月20号是一个非常好的日子，五二零，那么我们发布了全球首个互联网的神经网络机器翻译系统，简称为NMT，N就是Neural的意思，Neural Machine Translation，那么开启了NMT大规模的应用的一个翻译场景，开启了NMT大规模应用的新篇章。
"As we all know, in September 2016, Google also lauched its NMT system.",呃正如大家所知道的，在2016年的9月份，那么谷歌也发布了它自己的NMT的系统。
"Since then, neural machine translation has become a focus in both research and application.",啊从2016年9月份以来一直到现在，基于神经网络的机器翻译一直都是一个研究的热点和应用的一个呃热点。
But actually there are often difficulties to scale up a technology from laboratory to industrial application.,但是实际上我们在提到一个从实验室的研究到一个工业界的应用的时候，往往会遇到一些难题。
"Take statistical machine translation for example. When it was proposed in 1991, the data, machines, models and engineering realization at that time constrainted its application.",比如说以机器统计机器翻译为例，在91年刚刚提出来的时候，大家受限于当时的语料、机器、模型、实现等等。
It took 15 years before the first online statistical machine translation system came to the world in 2006.,一直经过了15年，到2006年的时候，才有了世界上第一个互联网的基于统计方法的翻译系统。
"After the neural machine translation was proposed, we carried out in-depth research on the aspects of efficiency, data and models, and quickly put it into application after improving it in many ways.",那么神经网络翻译方法提出来以后，那么我们从效率、数据、模型等方面对它进行了深入的研究，提出了一系列的改进方法，从而快速地把它应用到我们的翻译当中去。
Here I list some of the innovative and effective methods that we proposed.,所以啊这里面我们我简单的列出来我们提出了一些行之有效的啊一些创新的方法。
"These methods are published on top international conferences in the field, such as ACL and Triple AI.",这些方法都发表在我们本领域最高水平的国际会议上像ACL啊，Triple AI等等。
"If you are interested, you can check them out.",大家如果感兴趣的话，可以去看一下。
Now I will take one of them for example.,这里面我就简单拿其中一个作为例子给大家介绍一下。
"This is a NMT system we proposed in 2015, which is based on multitask learning. What problem does it try to solve?  it  the translation of less popular languages that we mentioned before.", 这是我们在2015年提出来的基于多任务学习的NMT的系统，它是解决一个什么问题呢，同样呢也是解决了一个刚才提到的小语种的翻译问题。
"For example, we have massive Chinese to English data, but fewer Chinese to Thai, Chinese to Japanese, and Chinese to Korean data.",比如说我们有大量的中英的数据，但是中泰、中日、中韩的数据我们很少。
How can we solve this problem? ,那么我们能不能提出一种方法，因为中文端都是相通的，我们在中文这一端呢呃都是共享一个编码器，那么不同的目标端我们使用不同的解码器。
We share the same encoder with Chinese as the source language.,在中文这一端，在源语言这一端，我们都共享一个编码器。
"As for target languages, each language has its own decoder. Therefore we realize the one-to-many translation.",在目标语言端，每一个目标语言都对应自己的一个解码器，所以这就形成了一个一对多的翻译。
"We can simultaniously translate Chinese into English, Korean, Thai, Japanese and other languages.",我们用中文可以同时翻译成英文、韩语、泰语、日文等等。
The work is reviewd by New York Times as a pathbreaking paper. It is a milestone and is widely quoted and used. ,所以这个工作后来被纽约时报评价为一个Pathbreaking paper，是一个里程碑式的文章，后来也被大家广泛地引用和使用。
"Likewise, we rolled out translation service on mobiles in 2015.",同样呢我们在2015年也推出了移动端的一些翻译，也就是手机端。
"For example, when you go travelling, you may suffer from no internet connection or high connection fee. If you download our offline package, you can enjoy high quality translation service from our NMTsystem.",那么比如说大家出去旅游的时候，经常会遇到网络不通或者是资费太高的情况，如果下载了我们的离线包，同样也可以使用我们的NMT系统获取高质量的翻译服务。
"Considering mobiles' limited storage resources and computing resources, we need do more to ensure the translation model works on mobiles.",那么在手机端受限于手机的存储资源和计算资源，我们需要做一些额外的工作来使这个模型可以运行。
"For example, we compressed the model to a size 70 times smaller so that it runs smoothly with 30MB of RAM on mobiles .",比如说我们首先把这个模型压缩了70倍，那么它只需要30兆的内存，就可以在手机端的流畅运行。
We also use some dynamic loading algorithms and we also pruned the vocabularies.,啊我们同样呢有一些动态加载的算法，啊还有一些词表的剪裁等等。
"With such optimization, we can easily use our NMT system on our mobiles, which now supports various languages including Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean and so on.",通过这样一些优化，我们可以在手机端可以很方便地调用我们NMT的系统，现在支持中、英、日、韩等多种语言。
"Baidu Translate has gained wide recognition from experts and scholars. For example, it was awarded the first prize of Science and Technology Progress Award by The Chinese Institute of Electronics in 2014. In the next year, 2015, it won the second prize of State Science and Technology Progress Award.",百度翻译的技术获得了专家学者的广泛认可，比如说在2014年百度翻译获得了中国电子学会的科技进步一等奖， 在2015年获得了国家科技进步二等奖。
"Here in the list are the papers we have published. If you are interested, you can search and download them online.",下面这个列表是我们学术论文的一个发表列表，大家可以去网上搜索，大家感兴趣的话可以去网上下载查看。
Thank you.,谢谢大家。
